abstract = {Livestock contributes directly to the livelihoods and food security of almost a billion people and affects the diet and health of many more. With estimated standing populations of 1.43 billion cattle, 1.87 billion sheep and goats, 0.98 billion pigs, and 19.60 billion chickens, reliable and accessible information on the distribution and abundance of livestock is needed for a many reasons. These include analyses of the social and economic aspects of the livestock sector; the environmental impacts of livestock such as the production and management of waste, greenhouse gas emissions and livestock-related land-use change; and large-scale public health and epidemiological investigations. The Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, produced in 2007, provided modelled livestock densities of the world, adjusted to match official (FAOSTAT) national estimates for the reference year 2005, at a spatial resolution of 3 minutes of arc (about 565 km at the equator). Recent methodological improvements have significantly enhanced these distributions: more up-to date and detailed subnational livestock statistics have been collected; a new, higher resolution set of predictor variables is used; and the analytical procedure has been revised and extended to include a more systematic assessment of model accuracy and the representation of uncertainties associated with the predictions. This paper describes the current approach in detail and presents new global distribution maps at 1 km resolution for cattle, pigs and chickens, and a partial distribution map for ducks. These digital layers are made publically available via the Livestock Geo-Wiki (http://www.livestock.geo-wiki.org), as will be the maps of other livestock types as they are produced. {\textcopyright} 2014 Robinson et al.},

@article{Cafiero2018,
abstract = {The ability of households and individuals to access food (one of the key aspects of 'food security') is an important welfare dimension that poses important challenges for objective measurement. This paper describes the Rasch model-based procedures developed to define the eight-item Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) as a contribution towards the establishment of an indicator for global monitoring of food insecurity. Experiential food insecurity survey data, collected by FAO from nationally representative samples of the adult population, once every year in 2014, 2015 and 2016 from 153 countries or territories, are used to develop methods to estimate cross-country comparable prevalence rates of moderate and severe food insecurity. A Rasch model-based scale was estimated separately for each country and data were assessed for consistency with model assumptions. To ensure cross-country comparability, a procedure based on the median normalized severities of each of the eight FIES items was used to define a global reference scale, against which measures obtained in each country can be separately calibrated. Calibration is obtained by equating the mean and standard deviation of the severity parameters of the items that appear to be common between the national and the reference scale, and thus used as anchoring points for the metric. Data showed sufficient consistency with the Rasch model assumptions to produce reliable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity in each country. Calibration was possible using 4 or more items as anchoring points in 151 of 153 (98.7{\%}) of the cases, and 6 or more items in the vast majority of them (121 cases). Concurrent validation of the estimates of prevalence of food insecurity at national level was obtained by comparing the FIES-based indicator with other established indicators of social (under) development. National prevalence rates of moderate-or-severe food insecurity obtained by FAO correlate well with the prevalence of undernourishment and with several widely used indicators of national income, health, and well-being. The proposed calibration method can be applied to other existing experience-based food security scales that use similar items, thus affording the possibility to use data collected with those instruments to produce internationally comparable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity. Pending broader adoption of the FIES or compatible experience-based food security scales worldwide, countries could choose to use the 2014–2016 results obtained using the data collected by FAO as the baseline to monitor progress towards Target 2.1 of the recently established 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.},

abstract = {This introductory text describes the principles of invariant measurement, how invariant measurement can be achieved with Rasch models, and how to use invariant measurement to solve measurement problems in the social, behavioral, and health sciences. Rasch models are used throughout but a comparison of Rasch models to other item response theory (IRT) models is also provided. Written with students in mind, the manuscript was class tested to help maximize accessibility. Chapters open with an introduction and close with a summary and discussion. Numerous examples and exercises demonstrate the main issues addressed in each chapter. Key terms are defined when first introduced and in an end-of-text glossary. All of the book's analyses were conducted with the Facets program. The data sets used in the book, sample syntax files for running the Facets program, Excel files for creating item and person response functions, links to related websites, and other material are available at www.GeorgeEngelhard.com. Highlights include: A strong philosophical and methodological approach to measurement in the human sciences Demonstrations of how measurement problems can be addressed using invariant measurement Practical illustrations of how to create and evaluate scales using invariant measurement A history of measurement based on test-score and scaling traditions Previously unpublished work in analyzing rating data, the detection and measurement of rater errors, and the evaluation of rater accuracy A review of estimation methods, model-data fit, indices used to evaluate the quality of rater-mediated assessments, rater error and bias, and rater accuracy. Intended as a supplementary text for graduate or advanced undergraduate courses on measurement or test theory, item response theory, scaling theory, psychometrics, advanced measurement techniques, research methods, or evaluation research taught in education, psychology, and the social and health sciences, the book also appeals to practitioners and researchers in these fields who develop or use scales and instruments.

Still, policy approaches aimed at strengthening local communities' adaptive capacity largely fail to recognize the gendered nature of everyday realities and experiences. This paper interrogates some of the emerging evidence in selected semi-arid countries of Africa and Asia from a gender perspective, using water scarcity as an illustrative example. It emphasizes the importance of moving beyond the counting of numbers of men and women to unpacking relations of power, of inclusion and exclusion in decision-making, and challenging cultural beliefs that have denied equal opportunities and rights to differently positioned people, especially those at the bottom of economic and social hierarchies. Such an approach would make policy and practice more relevant to people's differentiated needs and responses.},

Meanwhile, people are consuming too much fat, processed meat, salt and sugary drinks. Global food systems are failing to keep us all fed, let alone healthy. How food is grown, distributed, processed, marketed and sold determines which foods are available, affordable and desirable. These factors have a crucial role in the quality of people's diets, and hence play a vital part in health. Diet is the number one risk factor in the global burden of disease2. Poor diets are responsible for more of the global burden of ill health than sex, drugs, alcohol and tobacco combined. In the next few decades, food systems will be under further stresses from population and income growth, urbanization, globalization, climate change and increasingly scarce natural resources.},

This understanding will help orient, plan, monitor, and evaluate programs to improve the health and welfare of the W.A. region.   A principle intention of the WASAP project is to study the impact of the establishment/improvement of health facilities on trends in several population and health related statistics. To evaluate this impact, repeated measurements should be done in the same units noting the change in availability of services and the resulting change in use and outcomes. However, since the first round surveys included in the WASAP project were not planned for re-survey, new units were and will be used in subsequent surveys. There is a need to identify groups of "comparable" units in earlier and later surveys in order to track changes over time within these groups. One possibility is to use the survey information to identify comparable groups of units. This research note outlines a procedure for producing these units and provides a formula for assigning old and new units to the comparable groups.},

abstract = {West Africa faces a rapid growth in population and a subsequent demand for food production. Despite increasing demand, local farmers still follow traditional practices and try to overcome low productivity by continuously expanding cultivated areas. To assess the consequences of this expansion and to describe, based on anticipated population growth rates and land accessibility, the dynamics of agricultural land-use, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based ALADYN model of agricultural land use in the savannah around Kita, Mali. The model is based on remote sensing data on agricultural land use and data from field surveys. The ALADYN simulations clearly demonstrate that traditional agriculture is not sustainable. Even under the optimistic scenario of a declining rate of population growth, the current agricultural practices will result in the cultivation of all available agricultural lands by 2015. Under current practices, every farm will experience a period of 1-3 years every 15-20 years, during which field fertility will be too low to allow cultivation. Thus, to avoid severe food shortage, emigration or alternative sources of food are necessary. Comparison of the model and remote sensing data reveals that already in 2003 the cultivated part of the study area is lower than projected. That is, farmers anticipate overexploitation and, most probably, emigrate from the area. The model highlights the great need for new agricultural practices in West Africa.},

abstract = {Monitoring public perception of conservation is essential to ensure successful conservation outcomes. However, evaluating attitudes towards conservation projects presents daunting challenges because it is time consuming, expensive and open to social biases and small sample-size errors. Here, we present a recently developed approach to overcome these limitations – Internet-based methods - in particular offsite and onsite metrics. Offsite methods refer to Internet data mining tools that extract Internet search queries, such as Google Trends, while onsite methods refer to programmes that monitor traffic within websites, such as Google Analytics. We explore the potential of these methods rather than focus on the particular details of the case-studies provided to illustrate them. We used offsite methods to determine patterns in public interest in a reintroduced flagship species and in conservation awareness projects in the UK. We employed onsite metrics to assess the success in communicating a conservation outcome and to evaluate the success in online public engagement of a conservation NGO. Our results indicate that both offsite and onsite metrics are able to track changes in public interest across time and space. In particular, onsite metrics provide high levels of temporal and spatial resolution with a high degree of flexibility. These tools could add reliable information to traditional social surveys and represent an opportunity to improve our understanding of the drivers of interest in conservation.},

abstract = {Existing gender inequality is believed to be heightened as a result of weather events and climate-related disasters that are likely to become more common in the future. We show that an already marginalized group—female-headed households in South Africa—is differentially affected by relatively modest levels of variation in rainfall, which households experience on a year-to-year basis. Data from three waves of the National Income Dynamics Survey in South Africa allow us to follow incomes of 4,162 households from 2006 to 2012. By observing how household income is affected by variation in rainfall relative to what is normally experienced during the rainy season in each district, our study employs a series of naturally occurring experiments that allow us to identify causal effects. We find that households where a single head can be identified based on residency or work status are more vulnerable to climate variability than households headed by two adults. Single male-headed households are more vulnerable because of lower initial earnings and, to a lesser extent, other household characteristics that contribute to economic disadvantages. However, this can only explain some of the differential vulnerability of female-headed households. This suggests that there are traits specific to female-headed households, such as limited access to protective social networks or other coping strategies, which makes this an important dimension of marginalization to consider for further research and policy in South Africa and other national contexts. Households headed by widows, never-married women, and women with a non-resident spouse (e.g., “left-behind” migrant households) are particularly vulnerable. We find vulnerable households only in districts where rainfall has a large effect on agricultural yields, and female-headed households remain vulnerable when accounting for dynamic impacts of rainfall on income.},

Children were characterized as severely malnourished if MUAC was {\textless} 125 mm. Independent variables included various characteristics of children, households, and mothers. Average MUAC for all children was 130 mm; 33{\%} were severely malnourished. Of the severely-malnourished children, 54.2{\%} were female, and 45.8{\%} were male. The gender gap persisted in the multivariate situation, with female 1.44 times more likely to be severely malnourished. Other variables with a statistically significant relationship included the age of children, acceptance of DPT1, and education of household heads. The persistence of such a gender discrimination now when the country has achieved a lot in terms of child survival is striking. The issue is important and demands appropriate corrective actions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Survival and fitness attributes of free-living and sporocyst schistosome life-stages and their intermediate host snails are sensitive to water temperature. Climate change may alter the geographical distribution of schistosomiasis by affecting the suitability of freshwater bodies for hosting parasite and snail populations. METHODS: We have developed an agent-based model of the temperature-sensitive stages of the Schistosoma mansoni and intermediate host snail lifecycles. The model was run using low, moderate and high warming climate projections over eastern Africa. For each climate projection, eight model scenarios were used to determine the sensitivity of predictions to different relationships between air and water temperature, and different snail mortality rates. Maps were produced showing predicted changes in risk as a result of increasing temperatures over the next 20 and 50 years. RESULTS: Baseline model output compared to prevalence data indicates suitable temperatures are necessary but not sufficient for both S. mansoni transmission and high infection prevalences. All else being equal, infection risk may increase by up to 20{\%} over most of eastern Africa over the next 20 and 50 years. Increases may be higher in Rwanda, Burundi, south-west Kenya and eastern Zambia, and S. mansoni may become newly endemic in some areas. Results for 20-year projections are robust to changes in simulated intermediate host snail habitat conditions. There is greater uncertainty about the effects of different habitats on changes in risk in 50 years' time. CONCLUSIONS: Temperatures are likely to become suitable for increased S. mansoni transmission over much of eastern Africa. This may reduce the impact of control and elimination programmes. S. mansoni may also spread to new areas outside existing control programmes. We call for increased surveillance in areas defined as potentially suitable for emergent transmission.},

abstract = {An increase in funding for malaria control in the past decade has resulted in a dramatic increase in ITN ownership and use in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). There is a need to ensure equal access to the benefits of ITNs across socioeconomic groups. Using data from the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) and Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS), this study assesses change in disparity in ITN ownership among households from different socioeconomic groups between baseline (2003-2008) and endline (2009-2014) periods. The analysis compared Lorenz Concentration Curve (C-Curve) and Index (C-Index) values over time to assess changes in economic equity both at the individual country-level and pooled across all countries. Results show evidence of increasing equity in household ownership of at least one ITN by household wealth between baseline and endline periods. In 14 of 19 nineteen countries analyzed, ITN ownership either became more equitable or maintained equity between baseline and endline. Pooled analyses substantiated findings that the rapid and significant increase in ITN ownership has reduced or removed the previous bias that favored wealthy households. Findings from this study support the hypothesis that increased ITN coverage has been accompanied by reduced socioeconomic inequity in ITN ownership over the past 10 years. },

abstract = {The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for a comprehensive new approach to development rooted in planetary boundaries, equity, and inclusivity. The wide scope of the SDGs will necessitate unprecedented integration of siloed policy portfolios to work at international, regional, and national levels toward multiple goals and mitigate the conflicts that arise from competing resource demands. In this analysis, we adopt a comprehensive modeling approach to understand how coherent policy combinations can manage trade-offs among environmental conservation initiatives and food prices. Our scenario results indicate that SDG strategies constructed around Sustainable Consumption and Production policies can minimize problem-shifting, which has long placed global development and conservation agendas at odds. We conclude that Sustainable Consumption and Production policies (goal 12) are most effective at minimizing trade-offs and argue for their centrality to the formulation of coherent SDG strategies. We also find that alternative socioeconomic futures—mainly, population and economic growth pathways—generate smaller impacts on the eventual achievement of land resource–related SDGs than do resource-use and management policies. We expect that this and future systems analyses will allow policy-makers to negotiate trade-offs and exploit synergies as they assemble sustainable development strategies equal in scope to the ambition of the SDGs.},

Data on this trade however are sparse. A value chain approach was used to gather information on stakeholders in the chain from the harvesters in three major production areas in Cameroon to traders in Cameroon, Nigeria, and Equatorial Guinea, the socio-economic values, environmental sustainability and governance. Around 5190 people work in the complex chain in Cameroon with an estimated 4109 tons harvested on average annually in the period 2007 to 2010. Bush mango incomes contribute on average to 31{\%} of harvester's annual incomes and dependence increases for those further from the forest. Customary rules govern access to resources. Although regulations exist, most trade is illegal, with corruption and collective action governing access to markets. The majority of nuts harvested are sustainably collected. Although 51{\%} of the harvest is sourced from the forest, trees are also managed on cultivated land. Forest degradation and deforestation threaten the species. Policy measures such as linking stakeholders, promoting cultivation, pragmatic regulation, and supporting processer groups may make trade in this forest food more sustainable.},

In particular, we study the effect of isolation and transport infrastructure on welfare and agricultural productivity in the case of Madagascar. Madagascar is a good case study given the bad shape of its infrastructure and therefore the significant variation in isolation. Based on comprehensive household survey data combined with a census of communes, we discover a strong poverty–isolation relationship. Further we find the inverse relationship between agricultural productivity and isolation to be surprisingly strong. We isolate the following reasons why productivity might decline with isolation: (i) transportation-induced transaction costs, (ii) the inverse relationship between plot size and productivity, (iii) increasing price variability and extensification onto less fertile land, and (iv) insecurity.},

The study is based on the analysis of the Demographic and Health Survey conducted in the Dominican Republic in 1986. The results of the study show that the marriage and contraceptive use both inhibit fertility and reduce the theoretical rate by 44 percent and 46 percent, respectively, for the total population, whereas postpartum infecundability attributable to breastfeeding patterns has a less significant effect (16). With regard to the different socioeconomic variables, the postponement and interruption of unions reduced fertility by 51 in the urban zone almost double that of the rural zone (28 percent). Contraceptive use reduced fertility among all the groups analyzed. The most striking differences were among the illiterate women (33 percent) and among women with nine or more years of education (53 percent). The greater inhibiting effects of postpartum infecundability affect the fertility of illiterate women (24 percent) and the wives of those working in agriculture (22 percent), while the smallest inhibiting effects on fertility are found among women with nine or more years of schooling (12 percent) and among wives of  professionals, managers, and office workers (13 percent). },

We used household income data from 7975 households in 24 developing countries across three continents collected by the Poverty Environment Network (PEN). We found 77{\%} of households to be engaged in wild food collection from forest and non-forest environments even though the share of wild food income in total household income was on average only 4{\%}. Poorer households and households experiencing shocks derived higher income shares from wild foods. State land is the main source of forest-derived wild food income while private lands are most important for non-forest wild food income. Considerable regional variation in determinants and the direction of significant relationships indicate there is no one-size-fits-all approach to integrating wild foods into food and forest policies. However, our results reveal potential to increase household food security by integrating wild foods into national food policies in more customized ways.},

abstract = {In a time when protected areas are under increasing societal and political pressure, ensuring their public visibility and support will be essential to guarantee their long-term maintenance. The high levels of societal participation and global reach of emerging digital technologies provide exciting new opportunities to assess the public salience of environmental and conservation related subjects, including protected areas. Here, we test the relationship between measures of public interest and internet saliency of protected areas and evaluate how the characteristics of different protected areas relate to their cultural visibility. We show there is a strong relationship between public interest in protected areas (as measured by Google Trends) and their visibility on the internet. Our results also indicate that governance sphere and protected area category are the most important factors driving internet salience, with national parks being the most visible to the public. Other important factors include the age of a protected area, its geographical extent, human population density in surrounding areas and proximity to touristic centres. Finally, our results suggest that downgrading, downsizing and degazettement (PADDD) events have targeted protected areas independently of their public visibility but they were more likely to be enacted in those protected areas with lower levels of public interest. While further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between internet content and public sentiment towards different protected areas, our results suggest that internet saliency can be considered as a broad proxy of public awareness and engagement with protected areas.},

In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category±subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to- individual ratios). Rarefaction methods ± both sample-based and individual-based ± allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

@article{IPCC2011,
abstract = {This Summary for Policymakers presents key findings from the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). The SREX approaches the topic by assessing the scientific literature on issues that range from the relationship between climate change and extreme weather and climate events (‘climate extremes') to the implications of these events for society and sustainable development. The assessment concerns the interaction of climatic, environmental, and human factors that can lead to impacts and disasters, options for managing the risks posed by impacts and disasters, and the important role that non-climatic factors play in determining impacts. Box SPM.1 defines concepts central to the SREX. The character and severity of impacts from climate extremes depend not only on the extremes themselves but also on exposure and vulnerability. In this report, adverse impacts are considered disasters when they produce widespread damage and cause severe alterations in the normal functioning of communities or societies. Climate extremes, exposure, and vulnerability are influenced by a wide range of factors, including anthropogenic climate change, natural climate variability, and socioeconomic development (Figure SPM.1). Disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change focus on reducing exposure and vulnerability and increasing resilience to the potential adverse impacts of climate extremes, even though risks cannot fully be eliminated (Figure SPM.2). Although mitigation of climate change is not the focus of this report, adaptation and mitigation can complement each other and together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change.},

@article{Mei2007,
abstract = {Objective: Height- and weight-based anthropometric indicators are used worldwide to characterize the nutritional status of populations. Based on the 1978 WHO/National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth reference, the World Health Organization has previously indicated that the standard deviation (SD) of Z-scores of these indicators is relatively constant across populations, irrespective of nutritional status. As such, the SD of Z-scores can be used as quality indicators for anthropometric data. In 2006, WHO published new growth standards. Here, we aim to assess whether the SD of height- and weight-based Z-score indicators from the 2006 WHO growth standards can still be used to assess data quality. Methods: We examined data on children aged 0-59 months from 51 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in 34 developing countries. We used 2006 growth standards to assign height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ), weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ), weight-for-height Z-scores (WHZ) and body-mass-index-for-age Z-scores (BMIZ). We also did a stratified analysis by age group. Findings: The SD for all four indicators were independent of their respective mean Z-scores across countries. Overall, the 5th and 95th percentiles of the SD were 1.35 and 1.95 for HAZ, 1.17 and 1.46 for WAZ, 1.08 and 1.50 for WHZ and 1.08 and 1.55 for BMIZ. Conclusion: Our results concur with the WHO assertion that SD is in a relatively small range for each indicator irrespective of where the Z-score mean lies, and support the use of SD as a quality indicator for anthropometric data. However, the ranges of SDs for all four indicators analysed were consistently wider than those published previously by WHO.},

@article{Chotard2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malnutrition in preschool children, usually measured as wasting, is widely used to assess possible needs for emergency humanitarian interventions in areas vulnerable to drought, displacement, and related causes of food insecurity. The extent of fluctuations in wasting by season, year-to-year, and differential effects by livelihood group, need to be better established as a basis for interpretation together with ways of presenting large numbers of survey results to facilitate interpretation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To estimate levels of and fluctuations in wasting prevalences in children from surveys conducted in arid and semiarid areas of the Greater Horn of Africa according to livelihood (pastoral, agricultural, mixed, migrant), season or month, and year from 2000 to 2006.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Results from around 900 area-level nutrition surveys (typical sample size, about 900 children) were compiled and analyzed. These surveys were carried out largely by nongovernmental organizations, coordinated by UNICEF, in vulnerable areas of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Southern Sudan, and Uganda. Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) data were used for comparison. Data were taken from measurements of children 0 to 5 years of age (or less than 110 cm in height).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Among pastoral child populations, the average prevalence of wasting ({\textless} -2 SD weight-for-height) was about 17{\%}, 6-7 percentage points higher than the rates among agricultural populations or populations with mixed livelihoods. Fluctuations in wasting were greater among pastoralists during years of drought, with prevalences rising to 25{\%} or higher; prevalences among agricultural populations seldom exceeded 15{\%}. This difference may be related to very different growth patterns (assessed from DHS and UNICEF/MICS surveys), whereby pastoral children typically grow up thinner but taller than children of agriculturalists. Wasting peaks are seen in the first half of the year, usually during the dry or hunger season. In average years, the seasonal increase is about 5 percentage points. Internally displaced people and urban migrants have somewhat higher prevalence rates of wasting. Year-to-year differences are the largest, loosely correlated with drought at the national level but subject to local variations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Tracking changes in wasting prevalence over time at the area level--e.g., with time-series graphical presentations--facilitates interpretation of survey results obtained at any given time. Roughly, wasting prevalences exceeding 25{\%} in pastoralists and 15{\%} in agriculturalists (taking account of timing) indicate unusual malnutrition levels. Different populations should be judged by population-specific criteria, and invariant prevalence cutoff points avoided; interpretation rules are suggested. Survey estimates of wasting, when seen in the context of historical values and viewed as specific to different livelihood groups, can provide useful timely warning of the need for intervention to mitigate developing nutritional crises.},

abstract = {This study, conducted in two districts in Uganda, sought to examine the process whereby individuals seek HIV testing, how they are counseled, and the patterns of disclosure of test results to family and friends. The research focused on the experience of respondents, all clients at VCT sites, to understand their concerns about testing, counseling, and disclosure. The overall purpose of the study was to provide information useful to the Uganda Programme for Human and Holistic Development (UPHOLD) for designing interventions to make HIV/AIDS prevention programmes more effective. HIV prevention programmes promote HIV testing and counseling so that individuals learn their sero-status and can change their behaviour to protect themselves against HIV infection. Disclosure to others is essential in order to garner support for reducing the risk of HIV infection  and for accessing social and medical services. Although most programmes focus on individual behaviour and ways to change it, this study used a different strategy. By focusing on the social context of the experiences of VCT clients, the research shows how social interactions affected both the process of coming for an HIV test and the process of disclosing test results to others. With this approach it was possible to identify the kinds of counseling and social support most needed by VCT clients to share their test results with others and access social and medical services. },

abstract = {Using data from the two recent Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys, implemented in 2005 and 2010, this study examined changes in key HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, and sexual behavior indicators. The study revealed that there is some improvement in HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and sexual behavior, indicating that HIV/AIDS prevention programs in Rwanda are in fact having the desirable effects. Knowledge of using condoms as an HIV prevention method has increased in recent years. At the same time there has been a considerable increase in condom use during last sex and during last non-spousal sex; nevertheless, the level of condom use has remained low. There has also been an increase in the proportion of men and women who know that HIV can be transmitted from mother to child, and that transmission can be reduced increased significantly.	 The initiation of sexual debut of youth under age 15 remained low, and declined among men. The proportion of young adults practicing sexual abstinence (six out of ten) remained unchanged. However, there has been some deterioration in other indicators, such as an increase in the proportion of adults with multiple sex partners, the proportion of men who ever paid for sex, and the proportion of adults with STIs and STI symptoms. Changes in HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, and sexual behavior indicators in Rwanda between 2005 and 2010 are bidirectional. They indicate a need for intensified efforts from HIV programs to target certain sexual behaviors.},

abstract = {Background Most research manuscripts are not accepted for publication on first submission. A major part of the resubmission process is reformatting to another journal's specific requirements, a process separate from revising the scientific content. There has been little research to understand the magnitude of the burden imposed by the current resubmission process. Methods We analyzed original research article submission requirements from twelve randomly selected journals in each of eight scientific and clinical focus areas from the InCites Journal Citation Reports database. From the 96 journals selected, we randomly identified three recently published manuscripts and sent surveys to those first and/or corresponding authors (288 total) to solicit information on time spent reformatting resubmissions and opinions on the process. Findings There was significant variation in manuscript submission requirements for journals within the same scientific focus and only 4{\%} of journals offered a fully format-free initial submission. Of 203 authors responding (71.5{\%} response rate), only 11.8{\%} expressed satisfaction with the resubmission process and 91{\%} desired reforming the current system. Time spent on reformatting delays most publications by at least two weeks and by over three months in about 20{\%} of manuscripts. The effort to comply with submission requirements has significant global economic burden, estimated at over {\$}1.1 billion dollars annually when accounting for a research team's time.},

abstract = {In West Africa predictions of future changes in climate and especially rainfall are highly uncertain, and up to now no long-term analyses are available of the effects of climate on crop production. This study analyses long-term trends in climate variability at N'Tarla and Sikasso in southern Mali using a weather dataset from 1965 to 2005. Climatic variables and crop productivity were analysed using data from an experiment conducted from 1965 to 1993 at N'Tarla and from a crop yield database from ten cotton growing districts of southern Mali. Minimum daily air temperature increased on average by 0.05. ??C per year during the period from 1965 to 2005 while maximum daily air temperature remained constant. Seasonal rainfall showed large inter-annual variability with no significant change over the 1965-2005 period. However, the total number of dry days within the growing season increased significantly at N'Tarla, indicating a change in rainfall distribution. Yields of cotton, sorghum and groundnut at the N'Tarla experiment varied (30{\%}) without any clear trend over the years. There was a negative effect of maximum temperature, number of dry days and total seasonal rainfall on cotton yield. The variation in cotton yields was related to the rainfall distribution within the rainfall season, with dry spells and seasonal dry days being key determinants of crop yield. In the driest districts, maize yields were positively correlated with rainfall. Our study shows that cotton production in southern Mali is affected by climate change, in particular through changes in the rainfall distribution. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the seasonal tropics, vegetation shows large reflectance variation because of phenology, which complicates land cover change monitoring. Ideally, multi-temporal images for change monitoring should be from the same season, but availability of cloud-free images is limited in wet season in comparison to dry season. Our aim was to investigate how land cover classification accuracy depends on the season in southern Burkina Faso by analyzing 14 Landsat 8 OLI images from April 2013 to April 2014. Because all the images were acquired within one year, we assumed that most of the observed variation between the images was due to phenology. All the images were cloud masked and atmospherically corrected. Field data was collected from 160 field plots located within a 10 km × 10 km study area between December 2013 and February 2014. The plots were classified to closed forest, open forest and cropland, and used as training and validation data. Random forest classifier was employed for classifications. According to the results, there is a tendency for higher classification accuracy towards the dry season. The highest classification accuracy was provided by an image from December, which corresponds to the dry season and minimum NDVI period. In contrast, an image from October, which corresponds to the wet season and maximum NDVI period provided the lowest accuracy. Furthermore, the multi-temporal classification based on dry and wet season images had higher accuracy than single image classifications, but the improvement was small because seasonal changes affect similarly to the different land cover classes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Direct effects of soil or its constituents on human health are through its ingestion, inhalation or absorption. The soil contains many infectious organisms that may enter the human body through these pathways, but it also provides organisms on which our earliest antibiotics are based. Indirect effects of soil arise from the quantity and quality of food that humans consume. Trace elements can have both beneficial and toxic effects on humans, especially where the range for optimal intake is narrow.We focus on four trace elements (iodine, iron, selenium and zinc) whose deficiencies have substantial effects on human health.As theworld's population increases issues of food security become more pressing, as does the need to sustain soil fertility and minimize its degradation. Lack of adequate food and food of poor nutritional quality lead to differing degrees of under-nutrition, which in turn causes ill health. Soil and land are finite resources and agricultural land is under severe competition from other uses. Relationships between soil and health are often difficult to extricate because of the many confounding factors present.Nevertheless, recent scientific understanding of soil processes and factors that affect human health are enabling greater insight into the effects of soil on our health. Multidisciplinary research that includes soil science, agronomy, agricultural sustainability, toxicology, epidemiology and the medical sciences will facilitate the discovery of new antibiotics, a greater understanding of howmaterials added to soil used for food production affect health and deciphering of the complex relationships between soil and human health.},

abstract = {Using 40 rounds of Demographic and Health Survey data from 18 sub-Saharan African countries, linked to high-resolution historical climate records, we analyze the relationship between climatic variability and fertility goals among reproductive-aged women. We find that, overall, women exposed to above-average temperatures report lower ideal family size and reduced probability of desiring a first or additional child. Results indicate that exposure to precipitation anomalies during the 12 months prior to the DHS survey is associated with a significant reduction in ideal family size, but longer 60-month spells of above-average precipitation are associated with increases in ideal family size. Effects of unusual precipitation are null for women's fertility preferences at both shorter- and longer-term periods. Additional analyses show that this association varies across sub-populations defined by parity, education, residence in rural or urban areas, and region. In general, our results suggest that women exposed to adverse environmental conditions—namely abnormally hot or dry spells—will reduce their ideal family size and their preferences for having another child. In some cases, however, fertility goals may also decline during spells of favorable environmental conditions, possibly due to increased labor demands among women and their spouses. One implication of the observed links between climate variability and reproductive goals is that policymakers concerned with climate adaptation should work to ensure women have access to the necessary family planning resources needed to realize dynamic reproductive goals in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Much recent work on decentralized natural resource management has focused on the institutional arrangements that shape the balance of powers between central and local governments. It has given comparatively less attention to relationships between local government and community-level institutions. In Mali, decentralization has superimposed modern legal institutions on community institutions. The ambiguous relationships between them can undermine both the authority of nascent local governments and the performance of customary institutions. Legal pluralism-the coexistence and interaction of multiple normative orders with different sources of legitimacy and authority-helps explain the dynamic nature of local institutions under decentralization. This article examines the experiences of three Malian communities with decentralized natural resource management: one maintains autonomy from government, another engaged its local government, and a third negotiated a multi-stakeholder agreement-a local convention. They demonstrate that crafting workable relationships between communities and local government requires a pragmatic approach to negotiating and institutionalizing political space for innovation in self-governance. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Despite their socio-economic and ecological role, many studies have shown that the parklands are degrading very rapidly. Therefore, there is a need to undertake restoration actions for both production and environmental services. To do so, there is a need to identify factors that are affecting the dynamics of parkland systems. The present study aimed at characterizing and quantifying tree diversity of parkland systems taking into consideration the household's wealth status, land uses, market access and the type of farming system (cereal based on the ‘‘Plateau Central'' and cotton based in ‘‘Boucle du Mouhoun''). Six villages (Kienfangue ´, Ipelce Nionsna and Targho with poor access to the market) in the ‘‘Plateau Central'' and six villages (Bondoukuy, Ouahabou and Yaho with easy access to the market and, Dora, Fake ´, and Kuizili with easy access to the market and, Karang-Tanghin, ´na and Mamou with poor access to the market) in ‘‘Boucle du Mouhoun'' were studied. In each village, the Participatory Analysis of Poverty and Livelihood Dynamics method was used by rural farmers to rank farmer households of their communities and that gave three groups of wealth status that are poor, fairly well-off and well-off. Five households representing each of the three wealth groups in each village, giving a total of 15 households per village, were randomly selected by wealth group. Tree/shrub inventories were conducted in all land use types (house fields, village fields and bush fields) of the 180 selected households for the 12 studied sites. The number of species in the different land use types ranged from 96 to 102, but the majority of species were represented by less than 10 individuals. This indicates the selection effect made by the farmers to the parklands. Land use and farming system showed a clear effect on tree diversity in parklands. The effect of accessibility to market was evident in some cases whereas wealth status did not show any effect. Despite the statistical significant effect of farming system and land use type, the ANOVA models accounted for relatively little variation, indicating that other factors may contribute to tree diversity in parkland systems. The most threatened species were Adansonia digitata, Afzelia africana, Bombax costatum, Celtis integrifolia, Ficus asperifolia, Ficus iteophylla, Lannea velutina, and Parkia biglobosa. These species were represented in the largest diameter class (C80 cm) or showed very few individuals in the different diameter classes. Due to the increasing deg- radation of the parklands, a domestication and conservation strategy of key threatened species needs to be developed and implemented with the participation of local communities.},

The general level of contraceptive practice in the country is also high, as would be expected in a population with low fertility (a total fertility rate of 1.7). The abortion rate has remained so high because the use of modern contraception is so low; the primary method is withdrawal, which has a high failure rate. The use of modern methods has been increasing slowly; however, the decline in abortion in the recent past is more the result of postponement of marriage. },

Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists.

Assuring continuity of care has become a key program strategy for improving the health of mothers and newborns. Successful service delivery that offers continuum of care relies on understanding where the gaps are in seeking care along the continuum and what factors contribute to these gaps.  Three of every five Cambodian women received all three types of maternal care?antenatal care, skilled birth attendance at birth and postnatal care?for their most recent birth, which is a remarkable accomplishment for a country where 30 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Still, 40 percent did not receive all three maternal services. Regional variation was substantial. The proportion of women who received all three maternal services ranged from 14 percent to 96 percent among Cambodia?s 19 provinces. Differences between provinces accounted for more than one-third of the total variation in the percentage of women who went on to receive postnatal care after receiving skilled birth attendance. Despite success in extending the reach of maternal health care, Cambodia needs continuing effort to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality. Increasing continuum of care through an integrated service-delivery system involving both public and private sectors could be a solution to improving maternal and infant health.},

abstract = {The total fertility rate (TFR) in Nepal in mid-1976 was estimated at 6.3 births per woman, contraceptive use among currently married women was low (3 percent) and the proportion married was high. Given these demographic parameters, no immediate change in the fertility rate in Nepal seemed plausible. In recent years however, several researchers have noted that a fertility transition has been underway in Nepal. Data from the 2006 Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) show an unprecedented decrease in the TFR of 3.1 births per woman in 2006 from 4.1 births per woman in 2001. Many factors?socioeconomic and biological?may have contributed to this precipitous decline in fertility. However, actual levels and rates of change in fertility are less certain because they also depend on the quality of data and the accuracy of measurements used. Ideally, it would have been better to re-examine the levels and trends of fertility from the survey data with earlier surveys, as has been carried out by Retherford R. D. and Thapa, S. (1999 and 2004). Instead, the focus of this paper is on examining the possible factors underlying the recent unprecedented declines in fertility. The principal measure of fertility in this part of the analysis is the TFR.  Survey data are used to analyze the proximate determinants of fertility decline. The results of the analysis provide quantitative estimates of the contribution of changes in contraceptive use, marriage, breastfeeding and postpartum insusceptibility to the observed decline.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drought has many known deleterious impacts on human health, but little is known about the relationship between drought and intimate partner violence (IPV). We aimed to evaluate this relationship and to assess effect heterogeneity between population subgroups among women in 19 sub-Saharan African countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used data from 19 Demographic and Health Surveys from 2011 to 2018 including 83,990 partnered women aged 15-49 years. Deviations in rainfall in the year before the survey date were measured relative to the 29 previous years using Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data, with recent drought classified as ordinal categorical variable (severe: ≤10th percentile; mild/moderate: {\textgreater}10th percentile to ≤30th percentile; none: {\textgreater}30th percentile). We considered 4 IPV-related outcomes: reporting a controlling partner (a risk factor for IPV) and experiencing emotional violence, physical violence, or sexual violence in the 12 months prior to survey. Logistic regression was used to estimate marginal risk differences (RDs). We evaluated the presence of effect heterogeneity by age group and employment status. Of the 83,990 women included in the analytic sample, 10.7{\%} (9,019) experienced severe drought and 23.4{\%} (19,639) experienced mild/moderate drought in the year prior to the survey, with substantial heterogeneity across countries. The mean age of respondents was 30.8 years (standard deviation 8.2). The majority of women lived in rural areas (66.3{\%}) and were married (73.3{\%}), while less than half (42.6{\%}) were literate. Women living in severe drought had higher risk of reporting a controlling partner (marginal RD in percentage points = 3.0, 95{\%} CI 1.3, 4.6; p {\textless} 0.001), experiencing physical violence (marginal RD = 0.8, 95{\%} CI 0.1, 1.5; p = 0.019), and experiencing sexual violence (marginal RD = 1.2, 95{\%} CI 0.4, 2.0; p = 0.001) compared with women not experiencing drought. Women living in mild/moderate drought had higher risk of reporting physical (marginal RD = 0.7, 95{\%} CI 0.2, 1.1; p = 0.003) and sexual violence (marginal RD = 0.7, 95{\%} CI 0.3, 1.2; p = 0.001) compared with those not living in drought. We did not find evidence for an association between drought and emotional violence. In analyses stratified by country, we found 3 settings where drought was protective for at least 1 measure of IPV: Namibia, Tanzania, and Uganda. We found evidence for effect heterogeneity (additive interaction) for the association between drought and younger age and between drought and employment status, with stronger associations between drought and IPV among adolescent girls and unemployed women. This study is limited by its lack of measured hypothesized mediating variables linking drought and IPV, prohibiting a formal mediation analysis. Additional limitations include the potential for bias due to residual confounding and potential non-differential misclassification of the outcome measures leading to an attenuation of observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that drought was associated with measures of IPV towards women, with larger positive associations among adolescent girls and unemployed women. There was heterogeneity in these associations across countries. Weather shocks may exacerbate vulnerabilities among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Future work should further evaluate potential mechanisms driving these relationships.},

The first assesses empowerment of women in five domains, including (1) decisions about agricultural production, (2) access to and decisionmaking power about productive resources, (3) control of use of income, (4) leadership in the community, and (5) time allocation. The second subindex measures the percentage of women whose achievements are at least as high as men in their households and, for women lacking parity, the relative empowerment gap with respect to the male in their household.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Nutrition is the intake of food in relation to the body's dietary needs. Malnutrition results from the intake of inadequate or excess food. This can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity. OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review to assess research conducted by the International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and their Health (INDEPTH) of health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSSs) over a 15-year period on malnutrition, its determinants, the effects of under and over nutrition, and intervention research on malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS Relevant publication titles were uploaded onto the Zotero research tool from different databases (60{\%} from PubMed). Using the keywords 'nutrition', 'malnutrition', 'over and under nutrition', we selected publications that were based only on data generated through the longitudinal HDSS platform. All titles and abstracts were screened to determine inclusion eligibility and full articles were independently assessed according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. For inclusion in this study, papers had to cover research on at least one of the following topics: the problem of malnutrition, its determinants, its effects, and intervention research on malnutrition. One hundred and forty eight papers were identified and reviewed, and 67 were selected for this study. RESULTS The INDEPTH research identified rising levels of overweight and obesity, sometimes in the same settings as under-nutrition. Urbanisation appears to be protective against under-nutrition, but it heightens the risk of obesity. Appropriately timed breastfeeding interventions were protective against malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS Although INDEPTH has expanded the global knowledge base on nutrition, many questions remain unresolved. There is a need for more investment in nutrition research in LMICs in order to generate evidence to inform policies in these settings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Contraction of cardiac myocytes is initiated by Ca(2+) entry through the voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channel (LTCC). Previous studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling modulates LTCC function. Because PI 3-kinases are key mediators of insulin action, we investigated whether LTCC function is affected in diabetic animals due to reduced PI 3-kinase signaling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used whole-cell patch clamping and biochemical assays to compare cardiac LTCC function and PI 3-kinase signaling in insulin-deficient diabetic mice heterozygous for the Ins2(Akita) mutation versus nondiabetic littermates. RESULTS: Diabetic mice had a cardiac contractility defect, reduced PI 3-kinase signaling in the heart, and decreased L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) density in myocytes compared with control nondiabetic littermates. The lower I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice is due at least in part to reduced cell surface expression of the LTCC. I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice was increased to control levels by insulin treatment or intracellular infusion of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate PI(3,4,5)P(3). This stimulatory effect was blocked by taxol, suggesting that PI(3,4,5)P(3) stimulates microtubule-dependent trafficking of the LTCC to the cell surface. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of I(Ca,L) was also shifted to more positive potentials in myocytes from diabetic versus nondiabetic animals. PI(3,4,5)P(3) infusion eliminated only the difference in voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of I(Ca,L). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PI 3-kinase signaling in myocytes from type 1 diabetic mice leads to reduced Ca(2+) entry through the LTCC, which might contribute to the negative effect of diabetes on cardiac contractility.},

NTFPs have been identified as important to rural livelihoods, as an alternative land-use option as well as in fulfilling an important safety-net function although empirical evidence on the latter's strength is limited. Whilst NTFPs may contribute towards alleviating poverty, this safety-net function needs more critical and quantitative investigation. This includes the establishment of an applicable definition so this function can be communicated to policy makers and taken into account in national poverty alleviation strategies and, in attempts to promote resource-conserving behaviour by highlighting the value of natural resources (including NTFPs) compared to alternative land-use options. Poverty in rural households is complex and households are vulnerable to a range of shocks. During adversity households can turn to a range of possible safety-nets. What determines the use of NTFPs as a safety-net, how this safety-net function manifests and the strength of this function is poorly understood and there is need for further investigation.},

abstract = {By 2050, the worlds population is likely to reach 9 billion. Most of these people are expected to live in developing countries and have higher incomes than currently is the case, which will result in increased demand for food. In the best of circumstances, the challenge of meeting this demand in a sustainable manner will be enormous. When one takes into account the effects of climate change (higher temperatures, shifting seasons, more frequent and extreme weather events, flooding, and drought) on food production, that challenge grows even more daunting. The 2010 floods in Pakistan and excessive heat and drought in Russia that resulted in wildfires and a grain embargo are harbingers of a troubled future for global food security. This research monograph follows the 2009 release of IFPRIs widely read food policy report, Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation, which used a detailed global agriculture model to analyze crop growth under two simulated future climate scenarios. This monograph takes advantage of and expands on IFPRIs cutting-edge climate modeling expertise to address the climate change threat in the context of larger food security challenges. It provides the most comprehensive analysis to date on the scope of climate change as it relates to food security, including who will be most affected and what policymakers can do to facilitate adaptation. Building on previous research by IFPRI and other international organizations, this monograph examines a wider range of plausible economic, demographic, and climatic futures than has previously been analyzed.},

abstract = {This study analyzes the quality of perinatal mortality and retrospective contraceptive prevalence rates calculated from various instruments used in the Demographic and Health Surveys. Perinatal mortality: In this report we compared methods for estimating perinatal mortality in The DHS Program. None of the methods appear to adequately capture perinatal mortality by the standard that we selected. However, we found that the pregnancy history and the birth history supplemented by special questions performed better than the birth history supplemented by the reproductive calendar. Contraceptive prevalence tabulated from the reproductive calendar: We assessed the consistency of contraceptive use reporting in the calendar by comparing retrospective contraceptive prevalence rates tabulated from the calendar with independently estimated current status contraceptive prevalence rates from a prior survey. We compared estimates from the two data sources for the same point in time among women in the same age groups. We found evidence of substantial underreporting of retrospective contraceptive use in the majority of calendars analyzed relative to current status estimates. Results suggest that both stillbirths and contraceptive use are underestimated in data collected using the reproductive calendar. We recommend experiments in future DHS surveys: random assignment of some households to receive a birth history plus calendar and others a pregnancy history, or a forward pregnancy history versus a backward pregnancy history to assess the impact on reporting of stillbirths; and experiments with shorter calendars and potentially alternative methods of electronic data collection to assess the impact of these changes on reporting of contraceptive use and discontinuation.  },

abstract = {The main objective of this study is to evaluate the relative importance of the factors associated with the decline of fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis is based primarily on data from the Demographic and Health Surveys in 24 sub-Saharan countries that have conducted at least two surveys. Most of the findings are based on the characteristics of women, but in 22 of the countries trends for men are also included. An analysis also summarizes findings for 20-year intervals for 12 countries with more than two surveys  Declines in the total fertility rate are strongly correlated with declines in the number of children desired and with increases in the use of modern contraception, but only weakly connected with increases in age at marriage. In turn, changes in the number of children desired are determined mainly by urbanization, by increases in years of schooling, and by exposure to mass media, while changes in contraceptive prevalence are associated with increases in media exposure, mainly television, improvements in economic status, and reductions in infant mortality. Increases in schooling are the primary determinant of increases in age at marriage. These generalizations are shown graphically for all of the countries, and the conclusions are derived from a series of multivariate analyses of these relationships based on 207 internal regions of the 24 countries. Average changes in all of these determinants are also included for 16 Asian and Latin American countries for comparative purposes. They show the direction that the sub-Saharan African countries are heading. },

abstract = {This paper reviews the historic development of the conceptualization of ecosystem services and examines critical landmarks in economic theory and practice with regard to the incorporation of ecosystem services into markets and payment schemes. The review presented here suggests that the trend towards monetization and commodification of ecosystem services is partly the result of a slow move from the original economic conception of nature's benefits as use values in Classical economics to their conceptualization in terms of exchange values in Neoclassical economics. The theory and practice of current ecosystem services science are examined in the light of this historical development. From this review, we conclude that the focus on monetary valuation and payment schemes has contributed to attract political support for conservation, but also to commodify a growing number of ecosystem services and to reproduce the Neoclassical economics paradigm and the market logic to tackle environmental problems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we compared data from Instagram, Twitter and Flickr, and assessed systematically how park popularity and temporal visitor counts derived from social media data perform against high-precision visitor statistics in 56 national parks in Finland and South Africa in 2014. We show that social media activity is highly associated with park popularity, and social media-based monthly visitation patterns match relatively well with the official visitor counts. However, there were considerable differences between platforms as Instagram clearly outperformed Twitter and Flickr. Furthermore, we show that social media data tend to perform better in more visited parks, and should always be used with caution. Based on stakeholder discussions we identified potential reasons why social media data and visitor statistics might not match: the geography and profile of the park, the visitor profile, and sudden events. Overall the results are encouraging in broader terms: Over 60{\%} of the national parks globally have Twitter or Instagram activity, which could potentially inform global nature conservation.},

The scaled definitions of food security move from an early emphasis upon the attainment of food security at the international and national levels to a micro-level focus upon households and gendered individuals. The most recent changes link individuals to global modalities of governance with an emphasis upon the instrumentality of agricultural productivity in economic development strategies. Considering the contested and dynamic construction of scale in relation to the changing definitions of international food security reveals the political and ideological dimensions of these dynamics and their contradictions with the material history of hunger over the last thirty years.},

A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a "climate-smart food system" that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.},

Pressure to bear male children and poor nutritional status creates enormous stress on women?s health. Nepal?s maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is estimated at 281 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births for the 6 years before the 2006 survey, and although this level has declined by nearly 50{\%} from the 6 years before the 1996 survey, it is still high by world standards. Fewer children and more widely spaced childbirths are two of the most effective ways to reduce maternal mortality; 25{\%} of married women of reproductive age in Nepal say they want to space or limit their births but use no form of contraception.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Over the last 25 years, research on biodiversity has expanded dramatically, fuelled by increasing threats to the natural world. However, the number of published studies is heavily weighted towards certain taxa, perhaps influencing conservation awareness of and funding for less-popular groups. Few studies have systematically quantified these biases, although information on this topic is important for informing future research and conservation priorities. We investigated: i) which animal taxa are being studied; ii) if any taxonomic biases are the same in temperate and tropical regions; iii) whether the taxon studied is named in the title of papers on biodiversity, perhaps reflecting a perception of what biodiversity is; iv) the geographical distribution of biodiversity research, compared with the distribution of biodiversity and threatened species; and v) the geographical distribution of authors' countries of origin. To do this, we used the search engine Web of Science to systematically sample a subset of the published literature with ‘biodiversity' in the title. In total 526 research papers were screened—5{\%} of all papers in Web of Science with biodiversity in the title. For each paper, details on taxonomic group, title phrasing, number of citations, study location, and author locations were recorded. Compared to the proportions of described species, we identified a considerable taxonomic weighting towards vertebrates and an under-representation of invertebrates (particularly arachnids and insects) in the published literature. This discrepancy is more pronounced in highly cited papers, and in tropical regions, with only 43{\%} of biodiversity research in the tropics including invertebrates. Furthermore, while papers on vertebrate taxa typically did not specify the taxonomic group in the title, the converse was true for invertebrate papers. Biodiversity research is also biased geographically: studies are more frequently carried out in developed countries with larger economies, and for a given level of species or threatened species, tropical countries were understudied relative to temperate countries. Finally, biodiversity research is disproportionately authored by researchers from wealthier countries, with studies less likely to be carried out by scientists in lower-GDP nations. Our results highlight the need for a more systematic and directed evaluation of biodiversity studies, perhaps informing more targeted research towards those areas and taxa most depauperate in research. Only by doing so can we ensure that biodiversity research yields results that are relevant and applicable to all regions and that the information necessary for the conservation of threatened species is available to conservation practitioners.},

We first describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [8], which is the simplest kind of topic model. We discuss its connections to probabilistic modeling, and describe two kinds of algorithms for topic discovery. We then survey the growing body of research that extends and applies topic models in interesting ways. These extensions have been developed by relaxing some of the statistical assumptions of LDA, incorporating meta-data into the analysis of the documents, and using similar kinds of models on a diversity of data types such as social networks, images and genetics. Finally, we give our thoughts as to some of the important unexplored directions for topic modeling. These include rigorous methods for checking models built for data exploration, new approaches to visualizing text and other high dimensional data, and moving beyond traditional information engineering applications towards using topic models for more scientific ends.},

abstract = {Rural areas in Laos are experiencing a rapid transformation from traditional rice-based shifting cultivation systems to more permanent and diversified market-oriented cultivation systems. The consequences of these changes for local livelihoods are not well known. This study analyzes the impact of shifting cultivation change on the livelihood of rural people in six villages in three districts of northern and central Laos. Focus group discussions and household interview questionnaires were employed for data collection. The study reveals that the shifting cultivation of rice is still important in these communities, but it is being intensified as cash crops are introduced. Changes in shifting cultivation during the past ten years vary greatly between the communities studied. In the northern study sites, it is decreasing in areas with rubber expansion and increasing in areas with maize expansion, while it is stable in the central site, where sugarcane is an important cash crop. The impacts of land use change on livelihoods are also diverse. Cash crop producers hold more agricultural land than non-cash crop producers, and rubber and sugarcane producers have fewer rice shortages than non-producers. In the future, livelihood improvements in the central study site may be replicated in the northern sites, but this depends to a large extent on the economic and agricultural settings into which cash crops and other development opportunities are introduced. Moreover, the expansion of cash crops appears to counteract Lao policies aimed at replacing shifting cultivation areas with forests. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-positive people will lose weight and eventually become wasted or severely underweight. However, levels of obesity and overweight seem to be increasing in several sub-Saharan African countries severely  impacted by HIV and with little or no ART available. In many of these countries, HIV prevalence is higher among overweight  people than those of normal or below-normal body weight. To better understand this apparent anomaly, this study investigates the relationship between HIV, body mass index (BMI), and hemoglobin levels (biomarker for anemia) among adult women in sub-Saharan Africa. The study also investigates the relationship between HIV, women?s nutritional status, and their breastfeeding mode (exclusive, mixed, or none). In pooled analysis, HIV-positive status is significantly positively associated with being overweight, and is significantly negatively associated with being underweight. After controlling for wealth and other socio-demographic characteristics, however, the relationship reverses direction, and HIV-positive status becomes significantly positively associated with being underweight. HIV-positive status is significantly negatively associated with hemoglobin concentration, and the relationship  grows stronger when background characteristics and BMI are controlled for. There does not appear to be any negative impact of breastfeeding on the nutritional status of HIV-positive mothers compared with non-breastfeeding HIV-negative mothers. HIV-positive women who exclusively breastfeed their infants have slightly higher hemoglobin concentrations than HIV-negative women who do not breastfeed, after controlling for BMI and background characteristics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Stunting among children under five years old is associated with long-term effects on cognitive development, school achievement, economic productivity in adulthood and maternal reproductive outcomes. Accurate estimation of stunting and tools to forecast risk are key to planning interventions. We estimated the prevalence and distribution of stunting among children under five years in Somalia from 2007 to 2010 and explored the role of environmental covariates in its forecasting. METHODS Data from household nutritional surveys in Somalia from 2007 to 2010 with a total of 1,066 clusters covering 73,778 children were included. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical space-time model to forecast stunting by using the relationship between observed stunting and environmental covariates in the preceding years. We then applied the model coefficients to environmental covariates in subsequent years. To determine the accuracy of the forecasting, we compared this model with a model that used data from all the years with the corresponding environmental covariates. RESULTS Rainfall (OR = 0.994, 95 {\%} Credible interval (CrI): 0.993, 0.995) and vegetation cover (OR = 0.719, 95 {\%} CrI: 0.603, 0.858) were significant in forecasting stunting. The difference in estimates of stunting using the two approaches was less than 3 {\%} in all the regions for all forecast years. CONCLUSION Stunting in Somalia is spatially and temporally heterogeneous. Rainfall and vegetation are major drivers of these variations. The use of environmental covariates for forecasting of stunting is a potentially useful and affordable tool for planning interventions to reduce the high burden of malnutrition in Somalia.},

abstract = {There is an increasing understanding that forests and the forestry sector are key elements in poverty reduction strategies in Africa. However, issues of equity between various forest users are becoming a major challenge to environmental development, forest management and poverty reduction. This paper presents an analysis of household representatives' socio-economic determinants and other constraints on accessing forest products, based on data collected through a questionnaire survey of 1865 respondents in seven districts of the Sissili province, southern Burkina Faso. Three logistic regression models were developed to examine determinants of access to the forest for collecting fuelwood, grazing livestock and collecting non-timber forest products (NTFPs). The results showed that access to forest products is associated with individual characteristics. Age, ethnicity, occupation and sources of income were significant determinants of access to all types of forest products. Access to the forest for grazing livestock was further influenced by gender and household size, while access to NTFPs was influenced by gender, household size and education level of the respondents. The formal forest law that precludes grazing in the forest, and customary rules and regulations pertaining to land tenure, were reported to be serious constraints to forest access for women and migrant people. Understanding the factors influencing access to products from commonly-owned forest resources could form the basis for developing, modifying and targeting policy instruments that promote equitable access. Policies should particularly encourage the direct involvement of vulnerable and marginalized groups (women and migrants) in forest management activities. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Full text: Here is a great irony of 21st-century global public health: While many hundreds of millions of people lack adequate food as a result of economic inequities, political corruption, or warfare, many hundreds of millions more are overweight to the point of increased risk for diet-related chronic diseases. Obesity is a worldwide phenomenon, affecting children as well as adults and forcing all but the poorest countries to divert scarce resources away from food security to take care of people with preventable heart disease and diabetes.  To reverse the obesity epidemic, we must address fundamental causes. Overweight comes from consuming more food energy than is expended in activity. The cause of this imbalance also is ironic: improved prosperity. People use extra income to eat more and be less active. Market economies encourage this. They turn people with expendable income into consumers of aggressively marketed foods that are high in energy but low in nutritional value, and of cars, television sets, and computers that promote sedentary behavior. Gaining weight is good for business. Food is particularly big business because everyone eats.  Moreover, food is so overproduced that many countries, especially the rich ones, have far more than they need--another irony. In the United States, to take an extreme example, most adults--of all ages, incomes, educational levels, and census categories--are overweight. The U.S. food supply provides 3800 kilocalories per person per day, nearly twice as much as required by many adults. Overabundant food forces companies to compete for sales through advertising, health claims, new products, larger portions, and campaigns directed toward children. Food marketing promotes weight gain. Indeed, it is difficult to think of any major industry that might benefit if people ate less food; certainly not the agriculture, food product, grocery, restaurant, diet, or drug industries. All flourish when people eat more, and all employ armies of lobbyists to discourage governments from doing anything to inhibit overeating.  Food companies are well aware of the economic implications of reversing the obesity epidemic, as are government agencies. Economists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) calculate that "large adjustments" would occur in the agriculture and processed food industries if people ate more healthfully. That threat is one reason why food producers contribute generously to congressional campaigns, and why federal agencies have failed to take the obvious first step: a national obesity-prevention campaign in response to the Surgeon General's 2001 Call to Action. Such a campaign would have to address dietary aspects and include messages to eat less as well as the far less controversial "be more active." No other federal health agency has stepped in to lead the nation on dietary issues, which explains why USDA is left in charge of national nutrition policy. USDA's primary mission is to promote U.S. agricultural products ("eat more"), but it also issues advice about diet and health (sometimes meaning "eat less"). This notorious conflict accounts for the ambiguity of federal dietary guidelines ("aim for a healthy weight," "choose beverages and foods to moderate your intake of sugars") and the confusing nature of USDA's food guide pyramid.  If campaigns to promote more healthful eating are not in the best interest of industry, and government agencies are caught in conflicts of interest, how can any society address its obesity epidemic? The leadership vacuum in the United States leaves much room for litigation against the obesity-promoting practices of food companies. Whatever their legal merits, the current lawsuits engage the food industry's rapt attention and encourage scrutiny of their current products and practices. The vacuum also creates an opportunity for scientists and public interest groups to advocate better policies. Existing food policies could be tweaked to improve the environment of food choice through small taxes on junk foods and soft drinks (to raise funds for anti-obesity campaigns); restrictions on food marketing to children, especially in schools and on television; calorie labels on fast foods; and changes in farm subsidies to promote the consumption of fruits and vegetables. The politics of obesity demand that we revisit campaign contribution laws and advocate for a government agency--independent of industry--with clear responsibility for matters pertaining to food, nutrition, and health.},

abstract = {Twitter, a microblogging service less than three years old, commands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast. Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing. We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks 28. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85{\%}) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it.},

Yet, functional trait approaches have not been widely applied to agroecosystems and understanding of the importance of agrobiodiversity remains limited to a few ecosystem processes and services. To improve this understanding, we argue here for a functional trait approach to agroecology that adopts recent advances in trait research for multitrophic and spatially heterogeneous ecosystems. We suggest that trait values should be measured across environmental conditions and agricultural management regimes to predict how ecosystem services vary with farm practices and environment. This knowledge should be used to develop management strategies that can be easily implemented by farmers to manage agriculture to provide multiple ecosystem services.},

According to weight-for-age, 57.1 per cent of the children were suffering from underweight ({\textless} median -2SD) and 21.3 per cent of children had very low body weights which were {\textless} -3SD of standard. Height-for-age and weight-for-height data showed that 41.8 per cent of children suffered from stunting and 27.9 per cent recorded wasting. The children below one year of age had relatively lower prevalence of malnutrition than the other age groups. The prevalence of clinical PEM in the form of marasmus was found in 0.7 per cent of children, while kwashiorkor was absent. This study showed that malnutrition is still a leading problem among preschool children of Kalahandi district and this has not improved in spite of nutrition intervention programmes which are currently in operation.},

abstract = {Every year over 10 million people die of hunger and hunger related diseases. Nearly six million of these are children under the age of five; that is one child's death approximately every six seconds. Understanding how this still occurs amid the ever increasing social enlightenment of the 21st century—and under the auspices of a vigilant global developmental community—is one of the key challenges of our time. The science of food security aims to address such concerns. By understanding the multiplicity of the phenomenon, practitioners of global multilateral hegemony seek to shape appropriate policy to address these issues. The difficulty however is that the phenomenon is increasingly wrapped up inside an ever growing bundle of societal aspirations including inter-alia under-nutrition, poverty, sustainability, free trade, national self sufficiency, reducing female subjugation and so on. Any solutions therefore, involve fully understanding just what is indeed included, implied, understood or excluded within the food security catchall. Indeed, until such time as consensus can be found that adequately binds the phenomenon within a fixed delineated concept, current efforts to address the multitude of often divergent threads only serves to dilute efforts and confound attempts to once-and-for-all bring these unacceptable figures under control.},

However, key economic and human development indicators are still mainly provided only at national level, and downscaled by users for gridded spatial analyses. Instead, it would be beneficial to adopt data for sub-national administrative units where available, supplemented by national data where necessary. To this end, we present gap-filled multiannual datasets in gridded form for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI). To provide a consistent product over time and space, the sub-national data were only used indirectly, scaling the reported national value and thus, remaining representative of the official statistics. This resulted in annual gridded datasets for GDP per capita (PPP), total GDP (PPP), and HDI, for the whole world at 5 arc-min resolution for the 25-year period of 1990–2015. Additionally, total GDP (PPP) is provided with 30 arc-sec resolution for three time steps (1990, 2000, 2015).},

abstract = {Maternal undernutrition contributes to 800000 neonatal deaths annually through small for gestational age births; stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies are estimated to underlie nearly 3??1 million child deaths annually. Progress has been made with many interventions implemented at scale and the evidence for effectiveness of nutrition interventions and delivery strategies has grown since The Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition in 2008. We did a comprehensive update of interventions to address undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in women and children and used standard methods to assess emerging new evidence for delivery platforms. We modelled the effect on lives saved and cost of these interventions in the 34 countries that have 90{\%} of the world's children with stunted growth. We also examined the effect of various delivery platforms and delivery options using community health workers to engage poor populations and promote behaviour change, access and uptake of interventions. Our analysis suggests the current total of deaths in children younger than 5 years can be reduced by 15{\%} if populations can access ten evidence-based nutrition interventions at 90{\%} coverage. Additionally, access to and uptake of iodised salt can alleviate iodine deficiency and improve health outcomes. Accelerated gains are possible and about a fifth of the existing burden of stunting can be averted using these approaches, if access is improved in this way. The estimated total additional annual cost involved for scaling up access to these ten direct nutrition interventions in the 34 focus countries is Int{\$}9??6 billion per year. Continued investments in nutrition-specific interventions to avert maternal and child undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies through community engagement and delivery strategies that can reach poor segments of the population at greatest risk can make a great difference. If this improved access is linked to nutrition-sensitive approaches - ie, women's empowerment, agriculture, food systems, education, employment, social protection, and safety nets - they can greatly accelerate progress in countries with the highest burden of maternal and child undernutrition and mortality. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The study of contraceptive use dynamics typically encompasses the following topics: prevalence structure of the population, contraceptive discontinuation, contraceptive switching behavior, and contraceptive failure. Contraception discontinuation, switching, and failure become increasingly important phenomena as populations reach relatively high levels of contraceptive use, as is the face for Indonesia. The focus then moves from encouraging couples to adopt contraception to encouraging them to maintain use, to providing them with a range of options to suit their changing contraceptive needs. Informed policy decisions need to take into account the prevailing reasons for contraceptive discontinuation. Relatively few analyses on contraceptive use dynamics exist for developing countries. However, as more and more countries reach high prevalence levels, such analyses are becoming increasingly important for family planning policymakers. One reason for the lack of such studies is that the required data are not often available. The calendar section of the DHS core questionnaire is specifically designed to meet this data need. However, the calendar data place greater demands on the analyst since the techniques needed to make full use of these data are unfamiliar to many researchers. The principal aim of this report is to provide a more complete picture of Indonesia's contraceptive use dynamics than what was offered in the first country report, and to provided an assessment of changes in certain key indicators since the last IDHS survey in 1994. The report builds upon an earlier study of contraception undertaken using the 1994 IDHS.},

abstract = {Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982) 139–177]. We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the CTM to the articles from Science published from 1990–1999, a data set that comprises 57M words. The CTM gives a better fit of the data than LDA, and we demonstrate its use as an exploratory tool of large document collections.},

This paper introduces a new alternative for population synthesis based on Bayesian networks. A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution, encoding probabilistic relationships among a set of variables in an efficient way. Similar to the previously developed probabilistic approach, in this paper, we consider the population synthesis problem to be the inference of a joint probability distribution. In this sense, the Bayesian network model becomes an efficient tool that allows us to compactly represent/reproduce the structure of the population system and preserve privacy and confidentiality in the meanwhile. We demonstrate and assess the performance of this approach in generating synthetic population for Singapore, by using the Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS) data as the known test population. Our results show that the introduced Bayesian network approach is powerful in characterizing the underlying joint distribution, and meanwhile the overfitting of data can be avoided as much as possible.},

Separate logistic regressions were analyzed to assess women's risks of experiencing emotional, physical and sexual violence and multiple forms of intimate partner violence in the past 12 months. Twenty-nine percent of women in the sample experienced some form of intimate partner violence in the past 12 months, with 13 percent having experienced at least two different forms of violence. Significant positive associations with all forms of violence were found for lack of completion of primary school, history of violence exposure in women's families of origin either through witnessing violence between parents while growing up or direct experience of physical violence perpetrated by family members, partner's jealousy, partner's need for control, partner's history of drunkenness, and female-dominated financial decision-making. Significant positive associations were found between men's physical abuse of children at the community level and women's risk of experiencing emotional and physical violence. Neighborhood poverty and male unemployment, number of children living at home, women's attitudinal acceptance of wife beating, and male-dominated financial decision-making were additional risk factors for sexual violence. Women's economic independence was a protective factor for emotional and physical violence, while relationship quality was protective for all forms of violence and multiple victimizations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods Data on temperature, child and infant mortality were obtained for Matlab district of rural Bangladesh for January 1982 to December 2008 encompassing 49,426 infant deaths. To investigate the relationship between mortality and temperature, we adopted a regression with Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) errors model of seasonally adjusted temperature and mortality data. The relationship between monthly mean and maximum temperature on infant mortality was tested at 0 and 1 month lags respectively. Furthermore, our analysis was stratified to determine if the results differed by gender (boys versus girls) and by age (neonates ( 30 days) versus post neonates ({\textgreater}30days and {\textless}153days)). Dickey Fuller tests were performed to test for stationarity, and since the time series were non-stationary, we conducted the regression analysis based on the first differences of mortality and temperature. Results Hotter months were associated with lower infant mortality in Bangladesh. Each degree Celsius increase in mean monthly temperature reduced monthly mortality by 3.672 (SE 1.544, p{\textless}0.05) points. A one degree increase in mean monthly temperature one month prior reduced mortality by 0.767 (SE 0.439, p{\textless}0.1) for boys and by -0.0764 (SE 0.366, NS) for girls. Beneficial effects of maximum monthly temperature were on the order of 0.623 to -0.712 and statistically significant for girls and boys respectively. Effect sizes of mean monthly temperature were larger for neonates at 1.126 (SE 0.499, p{\textless}0.05) than for post-neonates at 0.880 (SE 0.310, p{\textless}0.05) reductions in mortality per degree. Conclusion There is no evidence that infant survival is adversely affected by monthly temperature extremes in Bangladesh. This may reflect a more heightened sensitivity of infants to hypothermia than hyperthermia in this environment.},

Given a large and growing human population, the persistence of widespread malnutrition, and the direct and significant threats the expanding agricultural system poses to biodiversity, the goals of providing universal food security and protecting biodiversity seem incompatible. Examining the literature shows that the current agricultural system already provides sufficient food on a worldwide basis, but in doing so methodically undermines the capacity of agroecosystems to preserve biodiversity. However, the available evidence emphasizes the interdependence of biodiversity and agriculture, and the important role each plays in the maintenance of the other. Thus, our review supports the claim that the solutions to the problems of widespread food insecurity and biodiversity loss need not be mutually exclusive, and that it may be possible to address both using appropriate alternative agricultural practices.},

abstract = {Child growth and nutrition in rural Papua New Guinea vary widely among different environments. The 1982-1983 National Nutrition Survey (NNS) was re-analyzed in order to relate patterns of growth to a wide range of dietary, socioeconomic, agricultural and demographic variables. Anthropometric indices of growth were calculated based on an internal Papua New Guinean growth standard constructed from the children included in the NNS. Children were subsequently classified as stunted, wasted or underweight if they were more than 1 SD below the national mean. Regression analyses on 15,975 children show that variation in growth among environments can largely be accounted for by differences in diet, although significant differences in relation to altitude, relief and rainfall patterns persist. Other important predictors of child growth and nutrition included socioeconomic status, maternal education, marital status of the mother and father's occupation. Variance components analysis revealed that most of the geographical variation in child growth was accounted for by the environmental, dietary, socioeconomic, agricultural and demographic variables included in the regression analyses. Most of the factors which were found to be associated with child growth in this study are related in one form or another to differences in local subsistence agriculture, which may therefore be the main determinant of child growth and nutrition patterns in Papua New Guinea.},

We find that women who were exposed to drought conditions during their early childhood are significantly less wealthy as adults. These effects are confined to women born and raised in rural households, indicating that the impacts of rainfall are felt via changes in agricultural output. In addition to lower levels of wealth, women who experience droughts in infancy also receive fewer years of formal education and, in the case of extreme drought conditions, have reduced adult heights. Our results also suggest that drought exposure in infancy can have long-term, negative impacts on women's empowerment. Finally, we also show that these impacts may be transmitted to the women's offspring, with children of affected women more likely to be born at a low birth weight (weighing {\textless}2.5 kg). To our knowledge, this represents the largest study to date both geographically and over time showing a strong relationship between early life rainfall conditions and adult outcomes, and the first to show that the impacts could span generations.},

Bee richness and abundance changed with habitat variables and we used this natural variation to test whether complementary resource use by the diverse pollinator community enhanced final yield. We found that pollinator diversity, but not abundance, was positively related to seed set of pumpkins. Bees showed species-specific spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation traits and within-flower behaviour, allowing for classification into functional guilds. Diversity of functional groups explained even more of the variance in seed set (r2=45{\%}) than did species richness (r2=32{\%}) highlighting the role of functional complementarity. Even though we do not provide experimental, but rather correlative evidence, we can link spatial and temporal complementarity in highly diverse pollinator communities to pollination success in the field, leading to enhanced crop yield without any managed honeybees.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, The Author(s). Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interact to increase the region's susceptibility and constrain its adaptive capacity. Climate change is commonly recognized as a major issue likely to have negative consequences on food security and livelihoods in the region. This paper reviews three bodies of scholarship that have evolved somewhat separately, yet are inherently interconnected: climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation, food security, and sustainable livelihoods. The paper develops a conceptualization of the relationships among the three themes and shows how food security's vulnerabilities are related to multiple stresses and adaptive capacities, reflecting access to assets. Food security represents one of several livelihood outcomes. The framework shows how several research paradigms relate to the issue of food security and climate change and provides a guide for empirical investigations. Recognizing these interconnections can help in the development of more effective policies and programs. The framework is applied here to synthesize findings from an array of studies in sub-Saharan Africa dealing with vulnerability to climate change, food security, and livelihoods.},

abstract = {This paper explores the effects of global goals on policies and ideas in development. The paper analyzes the consequences of the Millennium Development Goal hunger target on international development priorities and discourse. We argue that while the target did little to mobilize support to hunger as a global priority, it had more important implications for reshaping food security strategies. It reframed the narrative of hunger around under-nutrition targets that could be reached through narrowly focused and targeted interventions. Since 2000, strategies adopted by high-profile and well-resourced global initiatives emphasize short-term achievements of results, technological solutions, and the important role of the private sector. This contrasts with the 1996 World Food Summit consensus that conceptualized food as a human right, and food security as a multi-dimensional challenge emphasizing social, economic and political change. Although global goals focused on outcomes are intended to be neutral with respect to the strategic means to achieve them, the hunger target reframed the hunger challenge as a consumption issue amenable to short-term, technology-driven solutions. Left out of this frame are the long-term solutions to access, dependence on wage exchange, smallholder production, and social transfers. The choice of indicators also contributed to this simplification, marginalizing issues of vulnerability and instability in access, nutritional quality, and the host of social and political constraints. The target illustrates the power of target setting in framing the international development policy discourse.},

abstract = {A global map of drought risk has been elaborated at the sub-national administrative level. The motivation for this study is the observation that little research and no concerted efforts have been made at the global level to provide a consistent and equitable drought risk management framework for multiple regions, population groups and economic sectors. Drought risk is assessed for the period 2000-2014 and is based on the product of three independent determinants: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Drought hazard is derived from a non-parametric analysis of historical precipitation deficits at the 0.5°; drought exposure is based on a non-parametric aggregation of gridded indicators of population and livestock densities, crop cover and water stress; and drought vulnerability is computed as the arithmetic composite of high level factors of social, economic and infrastructural indicators, collected at both the national and sub-national levels. The performance evaluation of the proposed models underlines their statistical robustness and emphasizes an empirical resemblance between the geographic patterns of potential drought impacts and previous results presented in the literature. Our findings support the idea that drought risk is driven by an exponential growth of regional exposure, while hazard and vulnerability exhibit a weaker relationship with the geographic distribution of risk values. Drought risk is lower for remote regions, such as tundras and tropical forests, and higher for populated areas and regions extensively exploited for crop production and livestock farming, such as South-Central Asia, Southeast of South America, Central Europe and Southeast of the United States. As climate change projections foresee an increase of drought frequency and intensity for these regions, then there is an aggravated risk for global food security and potential for civil conflict in the medium- to long-term. Since most agricultural regions show high infrastructural vulnerability to drought, then regional adaptation to climate change may begin through implementing and fostering the widespread use of irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems. In this context, reduction in drought risk may also benefit from diversifying regional economies on different sectors of activity and reducing the dependence of their GDP on agriculture.},

abstract = {Global and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems aim to provide up-to-date information regarding food production to different actors and decision makers in support of global and national food security. To help reduce price volatility of the kind experienced between 2007 and 2011, a global system of agricultural monitoring systems is needed to ensure the coordinated flow of information in a timely manner for early warning purposes. A number of systems now exist that fill this role. This paper provides an overview of the eight main global and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems currently in operation and compares them based on the input data and models used, the outputs produced and other characteristics such as the role of the analyst, their interaction with other systems and the geographical scale at which they operate. Despite improvements in access to high resolution satellite imagery over the last decade and the use of numerous remote-sensing based products by the different systems, there are still fundamental gaps. Based on a questionnaire, discussions with the system experts and the literature, we present the main gaps in the data and in the methods. Finally, we propose some recommendations for addressing these gaps through ongoing improvements in remote sensing, harnessing new and innovative data streams and the continued sharing of more and more data.},

The promoters contain a constant sequence, consisting of an 18-base long dTALE-binding site and a TATA box, flanked by degenerate sequences of 49 bases downstream and 19 bases upstream. Forty-three of these promoters were sequenced and tested in transient assays in Nicotiana benthamiana using a GUS reporter gene. The strength of expression of the promoters ranged from around 5{\%} to almost 100{\%} of the viral 35S promoter activity. We then demonstrated the utility of these promoters for metabolic engineering by transiently expressing three genes for the production of a plant diterpenoid in N. benthamiana. The simplicity of the promoter structure shows great promise for the development of genetic circuits, with wide potential applications in plant synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The DHS Program conducted a pilot survey to investigate whether a revision of the standard set of questions on sexual activity would result in improved measurement of key sexual activity indicators, including extramarital sexual partners among women and sex with paid sex workers among men. The pilot survey, referred to as the 2013 Haiti Sexual Activity Pilot Survey (HSAPS), was conducted in Haiti and included a reorganized module on marriage and sexual activity. The module included questions similar to those used in the standard DHS questionnaires, but was organized by type of sexual partner, based on the respondent?s marital status. The pilot survey included 1,793 households, and interviewed 2,033 women and 1,696 men age 15-49. Results of the HSAPS were compared with the data from the 2012 Haiti DHS (HDHS) to determine if the measures of sexual activity obtained with the pilot survey questionnaires differed from those obtained in the 2012 HDHS, which fielded questionnaires incorporating the standard sections on marriage and sexual activity. The 2013 HSAPS did not find a meaningful or statistically significant difference in the percentage of respondents reporting multiple sexual partners in the previous 12 months compared with the 2012 HDHS, though the pilot questionnaires did collect some useful information about paid sex partners. In light of the fact that the revised module on sexual behavior does not appear to capture better reporting on the number of recent sexual partners, the DHS Program recommends against adopting the pilot module in the standard questionnaires. },

abstract = {Mapping key areas for ecosystem service (ES) supply is essential for the development of strategies that will ensure their future supply. Given the rapid development in this area of research, we performed a review of different approaches used to map ES, with a special focus on those that use social-ecological data. We used an analytical framework based on five criteria for analyzing and comparing the methodological approaches: the types of ES, availability of data sources, types of data sources, spatial scale, and methods used to model ES. We found that regulating services were the most commonly mapped, followed by provisioning, cultural, and supporting services. Secondary (readily available) data were used more frequently than primary data to map ES. Biophysical data (land-cover variables) and mixed sources (databases like global statistics) were the most commonly employed ones. Most studies were performed at the regional or at the national scale. The most commonly used method to model services was the development of models based on the well-known causal relationships between environmental variables, followed by the extrapolation of ES values from primary data to the total analyzed area frequently using land-cover maps. Our synthesis reveals that the majority of studies are based on secondary data, applied at broad scales, without validation techniques. There is an urgent need to develop methods for deepening our understanding of the social-ecological processes behind the supply of ES in order to improve our ability to map ES for decision making. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Improving clinical performance using measurement and payment incentives, including pay for performance (or P4P), has, so far, shown modest to no benefit on patient outcomes. Our objective was to assess the impact of a P4P programme on paediatric health outcomes in the Philippines. We used data from the Quality Improvement Demonstration Study. In this study, the P4P intervention, introduced in 2004, was randomly assigned to 10 community district hospitals, which were matched to 10 control sites. At all sites, physician quality was measured using Clinical Performance Vignettes (CPVs) among randomly selected physicians every 6 months over a 36-month period. In the hospitals randomized to the P4P intervention, physicians received bonus payments if they met qualifying scores on the CPV. We measured health outcomes 4-10 weeks after hospital discharge among children 5 years of age and under who had been hospitalized for diarrhoea and pneumonia (the two most common illnesses affecting this age cohort) and had been under the care of physicians participating in the study. Health outcomes data collection was done at baseline/pre-intervention and 2 years post-intervention on the following post-discharge outcomes: (1) age-adjusted wasting, (2) C-reactive protein in blood, (3) haemoglobin level and (4) parental assessment of child's health using general self-reported health (GSRH) measure. To evaluate changes in health outcomes in the control vs intervention sites over time (baseline vs post-intervention), we used a difference-in-difference logistic regression analysis, controlling for potential confounders. We found an improvement of 7 and 9 percentage points in GSRH and wasting over time (post-intervention vs baseline) in the intervention sites relative to the control sites (P ≤ 0.001). The results from this randomized social experiment indicate that the introduction of a performance-based incentive programme, which included measurement and feedback, led to improvements in two important child health outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.},

The report also discusses how the specific questions on FGC used in DHS surveys have changed over time (1989 to 2002). There has been variation in how women are asked about their circumcision status and, if circumcised, what type of circumcision was performed. There has also been variation in the way daughters are identified for purposes of determining circumcision status, and variation in the questions on individual perceptions about FGC. },

abstract = {Conservation agriculture (CA) changes soil properties and processes compared to conventional agriculture. These changes can, in turn, affect the delivery of ecosystem services, including climate regulation through carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions, and regulation and provision of water through soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Conservation agriculture can also affect the underlying biodiversity that supports many ecosystem services. In this overview, we summarize the current status of the science, the gaps in understanding, and highlight some research priorities for ecosystem services in conservational agriculture. The review is based on global literature but also addresses the potential and limitations of conservation agriculture for low productivity, smallholder farming systems, particularly in Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia. There is clear evidence that topsoil organic matter increases with conservation agriculture and with it other soil properties and processes that reduce erosion and runoff and increase water quality. The impacts on other ecosystem services are less clear. Only about half the 100+ studies comparing soil carbon sequestration with no-till and conventional tillage indicated increased sequestration with no till; this is despite continued claims that conservation agriculture sequesters soil carbon. The same can be said for other ecosystem services. Some studies report higher greenhouse gas emissions (nitrous oxide and methane) with conservation agriculture compared to conventional, while others find lower emissions. Soil moisture retention can be higher with conservation agriculture, resulting in higher and more stable yields during dry seasons but the amounts of residues and soil organic matter levels required to attain higher soil moisture content is not known. Biodiversity is higher in CA compared to conventional practices. In general, this higher diversity can be related to increased ecosystem services such as pest control or pollination but strong evidence of cause and effect or good estimates of magnitude of impact are few and these effects are not consistent. The delivery of ecosystem services with conservation agriculture will vary with the climate, soils and crop rotations but there is insufficient information to support a predictive understanding of where conservation agriculture results in better delivery of ecosystem services compared to conventional practices. Establishing a set of strategically located experimental sites that compare CA with conventional agriculture on a range of soil-climate types would facilitate establishing a predictive understanding of the relative controls of different factors (soil, climate, and management) on ES outcomes, and ultimately in assessing the feasibility of CA or CA practices in different sites and socioeconomic situations.The feasibility of conservation agriculture for recuperating degraded soils and increasing crop yields on low productivity, smallholder farming systems in the tropics and subtropics is discussed. It is clear that the biggest obstacle to improving soils and other ES through conservation agriculture in these situations is the lack of residues produced and the competition for alternate, higher value use of residues. This limitation, as well as others, point to a phased approach to promoting conservation agriculture in these regions and careful consideration of the feasibility of conservation agriculture based on evidence in different agroecological and socioeconomic conditions. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In July 2007 the results of the 2006 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS)were published. The results suggested a halving of the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) from the 1996 NDHS. The new figures indicate that maternal mortality is now as low as 281 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. In 1996, the NDHS found an MMR of 539 maternal deaths per 100,000 lives births. Despite these measured improvements, 82 percent of women still give birth at home in Nepal without the presence of a skilled birth attendant (SBA). This study examines trends in maternal mortality, use of maternal health services, and socio-demographic changes in Nepal using the results of three successive DHS surveys from 1996 to 2006. It draws on supporting evidence from national health service statistics from the Nepal Health Management Information System (HMIS), and indicators from Nepali facilities on emergency obstetric care, which were collected in 13 of 75 districts over the period of interest. Additional sources of data for this study are derived from the records of the Ministry of Health as well as recent budget surveys that record information on household expenditure on health. Problems of under-reporting and inaccuracy are associated with all of these data sources, but by using the information in combination, it is possible to build up a reasonably good impression of the progress in maternal health in Nepal.},

Multivariate Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition for nonlinear response models with deviation contrast normalization for categorical variables were used to estimate the proportion of the decline in anemia prevalence over time due to increases in ITN use. Weighted average ITN use increased from 12.2{\%} in baseline surveys to 44.3{\%} in endline surveys and moderate-to-severe anemia decreased from 17.9{\%} to 12.1{\%}. In pooled, multi-country logistic regression models controlling for residence, household wealth, multiple birth status, mother?s education, child?s age and sex, and history of recent fever, odds of anemia were significantly lower for children who used an ITN the night before interview compared to those who did not (OR = 0.81, 95{\%} CI = 0.70?0.94). Decomposition models reveal that the increase in ITN use between baseline and endline surveys accounted for 19{\%} of the observed decrease in moderate-to-severe anemia which is equivalent to a 1.1{\%} reduction in anemia prevalence. The changes in ITN use explained the greatest proportion of the total change in anemia between baseline and endline as compared to other covariates.  Results suggest that scale-up of malaria control interventions are likely to have measurable impact on moderate-to-severe anemia and consequently that anemia may be a useful impact measure. },

Consequently, there is a lack of spatial data on the dynamics of shifting cultivation landscapes on a regional, i.e. sub-national, or national level. We present an approach based on a time series of Landsat and MODIS data and landscape metrics to delineate the dynamics of shifting cultivation landscapes. Our results reveal that shifting cultivation is a land use system still widely and dynamically utilized in northern Laos. While there is an overall reduction in the areas dominated by shifting cultivation, some regions also show an expansion. A review of relevant reports and articles indicates that policies tend to lead to a reduction while market forces can result in both expansion and reduction. For a better understanding of the different factors affecting shifting cultivation landscapes in Laos, further research should focus on spatially explicit analyses.},

The lifetime prevalence estimates for women's undergoing physical violence from a partner were significantly higher in the Le{\'{o}}n study (52 percent) and Managua study (69 percent), compared with that given in the DHS (28 percent). Possible explanations for the differences are examined through pooled multivariate logistic regression analysis, as well as analysis of six focus-group discussions carried out with field-workers and staff from the three studies. The most important differences that were found concerned ethical and safety procedures and the interview setting. The results indicate that prevalence estimates for violence are highly sensitive to methodological factors, and that underreporting is a significant threat to validity.},

The research sought to discover if certain elements in social and family relationships influence the decision to use family planning or not. In Mali, as in many other West African countries, rates of contraceptive use have remained very low. How is it that some women who are not ready to become pregnant do not use family planning? To compare women who use family planning to those who do not, this study explored a number of themes: women?s experiences growing up, their participation in the choice of a husband, creating a family of their own, their knowledge of contraception, their fertility preferences, their access to services, their preferences for different types of services, and their socioeconomic status in the household. The study explored the relative importance of elements that affect the use of modern family planning methods from the perspectives of married women, married men, and service providers who offer family planning methods. },

abstract = {Spatial predictions of soil macro and micro-nutrient content across Sub-Saharan Africa at 250 m spatial resolution and for 0–30 cm depth interval are presented. Predictions were produced for 15 target nutrients: organic carbon (C) and total (organic) nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), and extractable—phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al) and boron (B). Model training was performed using soil samples from ca. 59,000 locations (a compilation of soil samples from the AfSIS, EthioSIS, One Acre Fund, VitalSigns and legacy soil data) and an extensive stack of remote sensing covariates in addition to landform, lithologic and land cover maps. An ensemble model was then created for each nutrient from two machine learning algorithms—random forest and gradient boosting, as implemented in R packages ranger and xgboost—and then used to generate predictions in a fully-optimized computing system. Cross-validation revealed that apart from S, P and B, significant models can be produced for most targeted nutrients (R-square between 40–85{\%}). Further comparison with OFRA field trial database shows that soil nutrients are indeed critical for agricultural development, with Mn, Zn, Al, B and Na, appearing as the most important nutrients for predicting crop yield. A limiting factor for mapping nutrients using the existing point data in Africa appears to be (1) the high spatial clustering of sampling locations, and (2) missing more detailed parent material/geological maps. Logical steps towards improving prediction accuracies include: further collection of input (training) point samples, further harmonization of measurement methods, addition of more detailed covariates specific to Africa, and implementation of a full spatio-temporal statistical modeling framework.},

This report documents the philosophy, history, and background of the DHS wealth index and describes the methodology employed in its construction and the decisions made about possible variations in the methodology. After discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of using a wealth index as opposed to income and expenditure measures of economic status, a comparison is made between the wealth index and the expenditure index in a particular setting. This comparison shows that the wealth index explains the same or a greater amount of the differences between households on a set of health indicators, even though the wealth index requires far less effort from respondents, interviewers, data processors, and analysts. Comparisons are made for five selected countries in the distribution of wealth among households and for some key demographic and social indicators. Additionally, key health, education, and use of public services indicators are tabulated according to quintile of the population distribution of household wealth, and comparative results for health indicators in the poorest quintile are presented for 44 countries. The use of the wealth index for addressing the needs of the poor is discussed and illustrated through poverty maps and nongeographic analysis. Also discussed is the joining of the wealth index to more traditional measures of poverty.  },

abstract = {Culturomics is an emerging area of study that explores human culture through the quantitative analysis of large digital bodies of text. Culturomics shows great potential for the study of public perceptions and engagement with nature and biodiversity, and thus to contribute to the assessment and monitoring of major conservation goals (e.g. Aichi Target 1). In order to realize the full potential of culturomic approaches for conservation applications, researchers must develop solutions for existing methodological issues. For example, the use of scientific binomial names in species assessments has been recently proposed as a means to account for linguistic challenges associated with vernacular names, such as synonyms and homonyms. However, scientific names can also be affected by scientific synonyms arising from changes in species nomenclature. Here, we focus on a culturomic assessment of internet content and evaluate the importance of considering scientific name synonyms in such assessments. For this, we estimated how much omitting taxonomic synonyms affected webpage retrieval for bird species. Results indicate that failing to consider synonyms affected the number of webpages retrieved for over half of the species considered. In some cases, such omissions were severe (over 50{\%} of total webpages omitted) and increased with the number of synonyms identified. We discuss the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of taxonomy in efforts to evaluate public interest in species using culturomic approaches and suggest that future studies should always strive to identify and account for any existing synonyms to minimize potential problems.},

abstract = {This report assesses the quality of the birth history data in 192 DHS surveys conducted since 1990. The birth histories are the source of the age-specific fertility rates, the total fertility rate (TFR), and the under 5 mortality rates that are widely used to describe levels, differentials, and trends in fertility and child mortality in developing countries. The assessment is based on three criteria to identify potential omission of births and/or deaths and three criteria to identify potential displacement, or misreporting, of date of birth, age at death, or both. Extreme values should be viewed as symptoms rather than a conclusive diagnosis of poor data quality. The birth histories in most DHS surveys appear to be of excellent quality, although several surveys do show symptoms of omission, displacement, or both. With the selected indicators and criteria, omission of births is usually at the level of 2 percent or less, and only rarely exceeds 5 percent. Displacement of births is also usually 2 percent or less, and only rarely exceeds 3 percent of births in the past 10 years. The omission of deaths is a higher percentage; but usually less than 5 percent, although it may exceed 10 percent in some surveys. Displacement of deaths is usually less than 5 percent, and almost never more than 10 percent. With some unevenness across regions, DHS-6 appears to be the phase of DHS that had the lowest overall levels of incomplete birthdates, flagged dates of death, and omission and displacement of births and deaths. },

abstract = {In recent years it has become clear that climate change is an inevitable process. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the expectation is that climate change will have an especially negative impact, not only a result of projected warming and rainfall deficits, but also because of the vulnerability of the population. The impact upon food security will be of great significance, and may be defined as being composed of three components: availability, access, and utilization. To further investigate the link, a systematic literature review was done of the peer-reviewed literature related to climate change and food security, employing the realist review method. Analysis of the literature found consistent predictions of decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, negative impacts on livelihoods, and increased malnutrition. Adaptation strategies were heavily discussed as a means of mitigating a situation of severe food insecurity across the entire region. This is linked to issues of development, whereby adaptation is essential to counteract the negative impacts and improve the potential of the population to undergo development processes. Findings additionally revealed a gap in the literature about how nutrition will be affected, which is of importance given the links between poor nutrition and lack of productivity. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {80{\%} of the world's undernourished children live in just 20 countries. Intensified nutrition action in these countries can lead to achievement of the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG) and greatly increase the chances of achieving goals for child and maternal mortality (MDGs 4 and 5). Despite isolated successes in specific countries or for interventions-eg, iodised salt and vitamin A supplementation-most countries with high rates of undernutrition are failing to reach undernourished mothers and children with effective interventions supported by appropriate policies. This paper reports on an assessment of actions addressing undernutrition in the countries with the highest burden of undernutrition, drawing on systematic reviews and best-practice reports. Seven key challenges for addressing undernutrition at national level are defined and reported on: getting nutrition on the list of priorities, and keeping it there; doing the right things; not doing the wrong things; acting at scale; reaching those in need; data-based decisionmaking; and building strategic and operational capacity. Interventions with proven effectiveness that are selected by countries should be rapidly implemented at scale. The period from pregnancy to 24 months of age is a crucial window of opportunity for reducing undernutrition and its adverse effects. Programme efforts, as well as monitoring and assessment, should focus on this segment of the continuum of care. Nutrition resources should not be used to support actions unlikely to be effective in the context of country or local realities. Nutrition resources should not be used to support actions that have not been proven to have a direct effect on undernutrition, such as stand-alone growth monitoring or school feeding programmes. In addition to health and nutrition interventions, economic and social policies addressing poverty, trade, and agriculture that have been associated with rapid improvements in nutritional status should be implemented. There is a reservoir of important experience and expertise in individual countries about how to build commitment, develop and monitor nutrition programmes, move toward acting at scale, reform or phase-out ineffective programmes, and other challenges. This resource needs to be formalised, shared, and used as the basis for setting priorities in problem-solving research for nutrition. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Overall, almost one in four births occurred after an interval of less than 24 months. Birth intervals between 36 and 59 months entail lower risk. No country has more than half of births occurring in this lower-risk category. Forty-six countries have more than one DHS survey, which allows for the examination of trends in birth intervals. For the 46 countries together, the median length of the birth interval increased by 3.1 months between the first and last surveys.  },

abstract = {Abstract: This article investigates changes in income diversification patterns for the case of Burkina Faso between 1994 and 2003. Contrary to common beliefs, our empirical analysis shows that rural households are not increasingly diversifying their income portfolios. Beyond insuring against and coping with weather shocks, diversification behaviour reflects structural change. Higher returns to agricultural activities, in particular in the cotton and livestock sectors, appear to be the root cause for less non-agricultural diversification and some of our findings hint at better opportunities in the non-farm sector. Yet, average returns in the non-farm sector appear to remain relatively low and migration increasingly turns into a desperation-led strategy. Overall, structural change seems to be biased in favour of richer households. Regarding responses to droughts, we confirm earlier findings, especially that the poorest households are hit particularly hard, being forced to sell livestock, which is often their only asset.},

abstract = {This child-focused deprivation analysis sheds light on child poverty in Ethiopia, measuring child deprivation by using a number of dimensions of survival and development. It presents how different dimensions other than income poverty affect child well-being by using indicators from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys (2000, 2005 and 2011) and matching those to the rights contained in the CRC. The study measures the levels of child deprivation for the under-five child population and assesses overall progress in child deprivation reduction in  Ethiopia over the years 2000 to 2011. The results show that while the deprivation incidence has decreased significantly in almost all dimensions between 2000 and 2011, the joint distribution of deprivations reveals that the percentage of children experiencing several deprivations at a time has decreased only marginally. In 2011, almost all children (94 per cent) still suffered from at least two deprivations considered as a threat to their survival or development. The average deprivation intensity was very high, children on average experiencing 3.8 deprivations at a time. This, however, is slightly lower compared to 2000 when children were on average deprived in 4.5 out of all six dimensions analysed. The deprivation overlap analysis shows differences in the extent to which the analysed sectors overlap, and reveals that children do not suffer from the same combinations of deprivations across regions. The study reveals significant disparities in multidimensional child deprivation levels between rural and urban areas and among regions},

abstract = {Many regions in Africa are currently being converted from subsistence to cash crop farming such as cotton. Agricultural intensification is usually accompanied by increased use of pesticides, which can have an impact on non-target organisms. Bats are particularly sensitive to insecticide loads while providing substantial ecosystem services as predators of herbivorous insects. In this study, pesticide residues in bats in a landscape in northern Benin were investigated, which spanned a land use gradient from an agricultural zone dominated by cotton farms, through a buffer zone, and into a national park. Insecticides used in cotton cultivation, such as endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, flubendiamide, and spirotetramat, as well as persistent insecticides such as bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT), lindane, and aldrine, were analysed. Insecticide residues detected in bats comprised DDT, endosulfan, and their corresponding transformation products. Maximum concentrations in the sampled bats were 11.2 mg/kg lipid of p,p'-DDE (median: 0.0136 mg/kg lipid) and 0.797 mg/kg lipid of $\beta$-endosulfan (median: below detection limit [DL]). While insecticide concentrations were below lethal concentrations our data suggest that DDT had probably been recently used in the study region, and larger scale use would pose an increased risk for bat populations due to the high biomagnification of DDT.},

abstract = {Introduction This chapter examines what is known about the effects of climate change on human health and, briefly, the more direct impacts of climate-altering pollutants (CAPs; see Glossary) on health. We review diseases and other aspects of poor health that are sensitive to weather and climate. We examine the factors that influence the susceptibility of populations and individuals to ill health due to variations in weather and climate, and describe steps that may be taken to reduce the impacts of climate change on human health. The chapter also includes a section on health "co-benefits." Co-benefits are positive effects on human health that arise from interventions to reduce emissions of those CAPs that warm the planet or vice versa. This is a scientific assessment based on best available evidence according to the judgment of the authors. We searched the English-language literature up to August 2013, focusing primarily on publications since 2007. We drew primarily (but not exclusively) on peer-reviewed journals. Literature was identified using a published protocol (Hosking and Campbell-Lendrum, 2012) and other approaches, including extensive consultation with technical experts in the field. We examined recent substantial reviews (e.g., Gosling et al., 2009; Bassil and Cole, 2010; Hajat et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2011; McMichael, 2013b; Stanke et al., 2013) to check for any omissions of important work. In selecting citations for the chapter, we gave priority to publications that were recent (since AR4), comprehensive, added significant new findings to the literature, and included areas or population groups that have not previously been well described or were judged to be particularly policy relevant in other respects. We begin with an outline of measures of human health, the major driving forces that act on health worldwide, recent trends in health status, and health projections for the remainder of the 21st century. 11.1.1. Present State of Global Health The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) pointed to dramatic improvement in life expectancy in most parts of the world in the 20th century, and this trend has continued through the first decade of the 21st century (Wang et al., 2012).},

Using household (n??=??427 in 2006, 2009 and 2012) total income panel data sets, with and without environmental income, from Nepal, we analysed the importance of environmental income in household-level poverty assessments (Foster-Greer-Thorbecke indices) and dynamics (movements in the Poverty Transition Matrix). Random effects logit and ordered logit models were applied to estimate variables covarying with poverty categories and compared for annual household incomes with and without environmental income. Using the without environmental income data set significantly changed the number of households classified as poor, as well as rates of movements in and out of poverty. Excluding household-level environmental income also distorted estimation of covariates of poverty incidence and poverty dynamics. Poverty incidence and dynamics models including environmental income perform better than those without. Rural poverty studies based on welfare measures excluding environmental income may thus be inaccurate for environmental reliant communities.},

abstract = {Forests provide important habitat for much of the world's biodiversity, and the continuing global deforestation is one of our greatest environmental concerns. Planted forests represent an increasing proportion of the global forest area and partly compensate for the loss of natural forest in terms of forest area, habitat for biodiversity and ecological function. At current rates, over 30{\%} of the remaining natural forest area will be lost by the end of the century and planted forests would then represent over 20{\%} of the total forest area. This places a greater demand on planted forests to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity and their provision of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services. We reviewed recent trends of deforestation, afforestation and reforestation to evaluate the effects on forest biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services. We placed particular emphasis on eucalypt plantations which continue to expand in numerous countries, especially in Brazil where rapid plantation expansion is creating the largest area of cultivated eucalypt forest worldwide. While government policies to associate plantation establishment with the protection and restoration of natural forests appear to be effective in the highly fragmented Atlantic forest, deforestation continues in Amazonia, mainly due to forest conversion associated with agricultural expansion. We conclude by reviewing methods for conserving biodiversity in planted forests at the stand- and landscape scales and with a view to enhancing the provision of biodiversity-related ecosystem services. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards methods were used to assess the association between potential predictors and the time to first episode of stunting, wasting and underweight.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 2387 infants (54.0{\%} male) were enrolled and followed for a median duration of 21.2 months.

Median time to first episode of stunting, wasting and underweight was 8.7, 7.2 and 7.0 months, respectively. Low maternal education, few household possessions, low infant birth weight, child HIV infection and male sex were all independent predictors of stunting, wasting and underweight. In addition, preterm infants were more likely to become wasted and underweight, whereas those with a low Apgar score at birth were more likely to become stunted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Interventions to improve maternal education and nutritional status, reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and increase birth weight may lower the risk of undernutrition among children born to HIV-infected women.},

abstract = {Climate change increasingly affects the livelihoods of people, and poor people experience especially negative impacts given their lack of capacity to prepare for and cope with the effects of a changing climate. Among poor people, women and men may experience these impacts differently. This review presents and tests two hypotheses on the gender-differentiated impacts of climate change on women and men in developing countries. The first hypothesis is that climate-related events affect men's and women's well-being and assets differently. The second hypothesis is that climate-related shocks affect women more negatively than men. With limited evidence from developing countries, this review shows that climate change affects women's and men's assets and well-being differently in six impact areas: (i) impacts related to agricultural production, (ii) food security, (iii) health, (iv) water and energy resources, (v) climate-induced migration and conflict, and (vi) climate- related natural disasters. In the literature reviewed, women seem to suffer more negative impacts of climate change in terms of their assets and well-being because of social and cultural norms regarding gender roles and their lack of access to and control of assets, although there are some exceptions. Empirical evidence in this area is limited, patchy, varied, and highly contextual in nature, which makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions. Findings here are indicative of the complexities in the field of gender and climate change, and signal that multidisciplinary research is needed to further enhance the knowledge base on the differential climate impacts on women's and men's assets and well-being in agricultural and rural settings, and to understand what mechanisms work best to help women and men in poor communities become more climate resilient.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Springer Science+Business Media DordrechtPeri-urban pressure on the Luki Biosphere Reserve in Bas-Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, is fuelled by growing demand in urban markets coupled with easy access. With data from 175 randomly selected households, this paper examines factors that motivate households to collect two major forest products found in the reserve for cash. We analyse the factors determining the choice of engaging in collection of bushmeat and eru (Gnetum africanum) and the factors determining the success (outcome) in collection using the Heckman selection model. This model explicitly separates estimation of selection into the activity from the outcome, to provide unbiased estimates of both. Results show that being local, higher household labour availability and higher asset endowment were positively related to selection into bushmeat hunting, reflecting higher risk-carrying capacities, ease of access to equipment and resources. Greater market distance being a female-headed household and greater age of household heads negatively affected selection into eru collection, reflecting characteristics of cash harvesting activities. Low education and more local knowledge characterised more successful outcome of eru collection, whereas having more household labour tended to lower outcomes of both bushmeat and eru collection suggesting that labour pools engaged in these activities were not sufficiently skilled, or that a higher proportion was consumed in such households. We discuss our findings in relation to the role of these activities in providing a pathway out of poverty and stress the needs for better integration of conservation and development policies.},

abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse the influence of commodified cotton production on soil fertility in southern Mali. From the late 1950s and until recently, production of both cash-crop cotton and food crops have increased rapidly in this region, giving it a reputation of being an African 'success story'. The flip side of this economic success is, however, said to be environmental degradation especially in terms of loss of soil fertility. We collected 273 soil samples in 19 villages located in various zones of land use intensity. In each village, the samples were collected on up to six different land use types varying with intensification. The analysis of the soil samples showed that soil fertility was highest in the sacred groves that have been protected and never cultivated. However, comparing soils under continuous cultivation and soils under fallow no clear trends in soil fertility were found. Cotton yields have declined since the early 1990s, while the total use of fertilisers has increased. This is often interpreted as proof of soil exhaustion, but there is no clear indication in this study that cotton-cereal rotation as practiced by smallholders in southern Mali reduces soil fertility. We argue that the decline in yields has been caused by an extensification process. Cotton fields expanded rapidly, due to attractive cotton prices in the 1990s, leading to falling investments per ha and cultivation of more marginal lands. These findings also have implications for a political ecology of commodity production and lead us to argue for an open-ended and empirically based 'critical political ecology'. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Childhood stunting is the best overall indicator of children's well-being and an accurate reflection of social inequalities. Stunting is the most prevalent form of child malnutrition with an estimated 161 million children worldwide in 2013 falling below -2 SD from the length-for-age/height-for-age World Health Organization Child Growth Standards median. Many more millions suffer from some degree of growth faltering as the entire length-for-age/height-for-age z-score distribution is shifted to the left indicating that all children, and not only those falling below a specific cutoff, are affected. Despite global consensus on how to define and measure it, stunting often goes unrecognized in communities where short stature is the norm as linear growth is not routinely assessed in primary health care settings and it is difficult to visually recognize it. Growth faltering often begins in utero and continues for at least the first 2 years of post-natal life. Linear growth failure serves as a marker of multiple pathological disorders associated with increased morbidity and mortality, loss of physical growth potential, reduced neurodevelopmental and cognitive function and an elevated risk of chronic disease in adulthood. The severe irreversible physical and neurocognitive damage that accompanies stunted growth poses a major threat to human development. Increased awareness of stunting's magnitude and devastating consequences has resulted in its being identified as a major global health priority and the focus of international attention at the highest levels with global targets set for 2025 and beyond. The challenge is to prevent linear growth failure while keeping child overweight and obesity at bay.},

abstract = {Background: The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the global ambition of "leaving no one behind". Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030. Methods: We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 25th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 975th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment. Findings Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 567 (IQR 319-668) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (868, 95{\%} uncertainty interval 846-889), Iceland (860, 841-876), and Sweden (856, 818-878) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (109, 96-119), the Central African Republic (110, 88-138), and Somalia (113, 95-131) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60{\%} of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5{\%} of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past. Interpretation GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations.},

abstract = {Should farming and conservation policies aim broadly to separate land for nature and land for production (land sparing) or integrate production and conservation on the same land (wildlife-friendly farming)? Most studies that try to address this question suffer from flaws in sampling design, inappropriate metrics, and/or failure to measure biodiversity baselines. We discuss how these failings can be addressed, and what existing information tells us about the key debates on this topic. The evidence available suggests that trade-offs between biodiversity and yield are prevalent. While there are some wildlife-friendly farming systems that support high species richness, a large proportion of wild species cannot survive in even the most benign farming systems. To conserve those species, protection of wild lands will remain essential. Sustainable intensification could help to facilitate sparing of such lands, provided that as much attention is given to protecting habitats as to raising yields. We discuss the general circumstances under which yield increases can facilitate land sparing, recognising that policies and social safeguards will need to be context-specific. In some situations, bringing degraded lands into production could help reduce pressure on wild lands, but much more information is needed on the biodiversity implications of using degraded lands. We conclude that restricting human requirements for land globally will be important in limiting the impacts on biodiversity of increasing food production. To achieve this, society will need to integrate explicit conservation objectives into local, regional and international policies affecting the food system. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {The paper scrutinizes that the changes in any sub-system (i.e. agriculture, livestock and forest) have direct impact on biophysical and social processes in village ecosystem of the central Himalayan region. In view of this, we studied the changes in spatial patterns of agricultural land use and dependency of agroecosystem on forest and animal husbandry over a period of two decades. Based on data analysis it was found that the cultivation of some traditional crops has either been abandoned in the area or declined by 25{\%}-85{\%} due to introduction of cash crops viz., potato, kidney bean and apple farming with acreage increased up to 51{\%}-72{\%} in the last three decades. Livestock population of different categories has declined drastically by 17{\%}-75{\%}, and has resulted shortage of farmyard manure, deterioration of soil quality and fertility which leads to un-sustainability of agriculture system. The changes in agrobiodiversity have led to the dramatic increase in soil loss and runoff from the croplands together with the increase pressure on forests. The economic evaluation of each crop showed higher monetary benefit from cash crops as compared to traditional crops. Among all the evaluated crops, the monetary output/input ratio was found highest (3.04) for kidney bean and lowest (1.26) for paddy. Changes in land use and management have improved household income but at the cost of forest degradation, less productive animal husbandry and loss of agrodiversity in the region. Therefore, there is an urgent need to bring desirable changes in agricultural policy, research, land use and efficient management of the resources for maintaining sustainability in agro and Himalayan forest ecosystem.},

It finds dependence on food purchases widespread and revenue from the own-account activities of nonhousehold heads essential to food security. Gender and the wealth of households are found to influence some, but not all, income generating activities and expenditures. Three household food procurement profiles are identified: investment in cattle, market gardens and bush extraction, and remittances. The case study village has agroecological characteristics and market proximity, which set it and other urban hinterland villages apart from the more cotton- and cattle-based zones of southern Mali. Own-account income generating activities may be able to increase revenue for women and junior men through a reallocation of household resources without entirely undermining the basis for a larger subsistence-oriented household.

LCCS is a comprehensive, standardized a priori classification system designed to meet specific user requirements, and created for mapping exercises, independent of the scale or means used to map. It enables a comparison of land cover classes regardless of data source, thematic discipline or country. The LCCS system enhances the standardization process and minimizes the problem of dealing with a very large amount of pre-defined classes. To facilitate the complex classification process and ensure standardization, innovative software has been developed to guide the user to select the appropriate class. The following manual accompanies version 2 of the LCCS software, which has been developed on the experience gained from numerous FAO/UNEP and country mapping activities including the Africover East Africa Project. The new version of the LCCS software is fully compatible with the previous version to ensure continuity of past and future LCCS mapping activities. Land Cover Classification System (LCCS},

abstract = {While the explosive growth of social network sites is a common phenomenon across many countries, the ways people use them and their reasons for doing so may differ depending on their social and cultural milieu, for fundamental values are divergent from culture to culture. This study is an attempt to examine how cultural contexts shape the use of communication technology by examining the motives for and patterns of using social network sites among college students in the US and Korea. The findings of this study suggest that the major motives for using social network sites - seeking friends, social support, entertainment, information, and convenience - are similar between the two countries, though the weights placed on these motives are different. Reflecting the unique social nature of the medium, Korean college students put more weight on obtaining social support from existing social relationships, while American students place relatively greater emphasis on seeking entertainment. Additionally, American college students' networks in an online social venue are far larger than their Korean counterparts, which may reflect the cultural difference between the two countries regarding developing and managing social relationships. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To reduce their dependence on subsistence agriculture, farm households in rural Africa may diversify their income sources by participating in the nonfarm sector. In years of drought, nonfarm income can also be part of the coping strategies. A multivariate sample selection model was used to analyze three years of data from a nationally representative household survey in Mozambique. The analysis was guided by the following three questions. During a drought year: (1) Do households increase their participation in nonfarm activities? (2) Are poorer households as likely as others to participate in and benefit from nonfarm activities? and (3) Which factors are associated with higher nonfarm incomes? The results suggest that households are more likely to engage in at least one nonfarm income-generating activity during a drought year. Although poorer households are more likely to engage in nonfarm activities, they are less likely to participate in nonfarm activities of high return. The results suggest that policies reducing entry barriers (e.g., improved road infrastructure, micro-credit schemes, and livestock promotion programs) and increasing education levels can facilitate income diversification, thus allowing rural households to better cope with the effects of drought. When designing polices, care must be taken to avoid exacerbating income inequality by targeting measures toward poorer and female-headed households. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

This paper presents a comparative event history analysis aimed at understanding how rainfall variations may influence child mortality in two neighbouring countries, Burkina Faso and Mali.

Individual data for both countries came from two detailed nationally representative retrospective surveys conducted in 2000. Rainfall data for the 1960-1998 time period were obtained from the Climatic Research Unit.

There was substantial variability among nations and among provinces within nations. Most national variability for stunting (76{\%}) and wasting (66{\%}) was explained by national factors and geographic region. Higher energy availability, female literacy and gross product were the most important factors associated with lower prevalence of stunting. The association of health expenditures and stunting differed by region. Higher immunization rate and, for Asia only, energy availability were the most important factors associated with lower prevalence of wasting. Regional differences in the relationship between stunting and wasting were accounted for by national factors. Some factors associated with stunting and wasting differ at the national level. Child malnutrition within a household is greatly influenced by issues at national and provincial levels, and intervention should be considered at all three levels.},

Data are from 17 recent national DHS and AIS surveys with HIV testing conducted during 2001 and 2006. Blood samples were collected and tested for HIV using standard laboratory and quality-control procedures. For each of the 14 countries with HIV serostatus data linked to individual characteristics and behaviors, we predict HIV prevalence among non-responding adults on the basis of multivariate statistical models of HIV for those who were interviewed and tested, using a common set of predictor variables. In the 14 countries with linked data, the HIV testing rate varied from a low of 63 percent among men in Malawi and Zimbabwe to a high of 97 percent among women in Rwanda. Non-response rate was higher among urban, more educated, and wealthier men and women but had no clear association with various risk and protective behavioral factors. Although non-tested men and women tend to have higher predicted HIV prevalence than those tested, the overall effect of non-response bias on observed prevalence estimates was small and not significant in all countries. In the 14 countries, HIV prevalence estimates adjusted for non-response bias were on average only 3 percent and 2 percent higher than the observed, non-adjusted estimates for men and women, respectively. The study finds that non-response for HIV testing tends to have small, non-significant effects on national HIV seroprevalence estimates obtained from national household surveys. },

The determinants and effects of diversification in the areas of poverty, income distribution, farm output and gender are examined. Some policy inferences are summarised. The conclusion is reached that removal of constraints to, and expansion of opportunities for, diversification are desirable policy objectives because they give individuals and households more capabilities to improve livelihood security and to raise living standards.},

Understanding this link is critical for a wide-range of decision-making contexts. While there have been several attempts to come up with a classification scheme for ecosystem services, there has not been an agreed upon, meaningful and consistent definition for ecosystem services. In this paper we offer a definition of ecosystem services that is likely to be operational for ecosystem service research and several classification schemes. We argue that any attempt at classifying ecosystem services should be based on both the characteristics of the ecosystems of interest and a decision context for which the concept of ecosystem services is being mobilized. Because of this there is not one classification scheme that will be adequate for the many contexts in which ecosystem service research may be utilized. We discuss several examples of how classification schemes will be a function of both ecosystem and ecosystem service characteristics and the decision-making context. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Agricultural production is highly vulnerable even to 2C (low-end) predictions for global mean temperatures in 2100, with major implications for rural poverty and for both rural and urban food security. Agriculture also presents untapped opportunities for mitigation, given the large land area under crops and rangeland, and the additional mitigation potential of aquaculture. This paper presents a summary of current knowledge on options to support farmers, particularly smallholder farmers, in achieving food security through agriculture under climate change. Actions towards adaptation fall into two broad overlapping areas: (1) accelerated adaptation to progressive climate change over decadal time scales, for example integrated packages of technology, agronomy and policy options for farmers and food systems, and (2) better management of agricultural risks associated with increasing climate variability and extreme events, for example improved climate information services and safety nets. Maximization of agriculture's mitigation potential will require investments in technological innovation and agricultural intensification linked to increased efficiency of inputs, and creation of incentives and monitoring systems that are inclusive of smallholder farmers. Food systems faced with climate change need urgent, broad-based action in spite of uncertainties. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is possible to measure the three recommended indicators in Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS) with minor alterations of the standard questionnaires; however, there are challenges to collect accurate and complete data as well as limitations to their interpretation. Five countries have collected and released data on concurrent sexual partnerships: Congo Brazzaville, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania. Challenges in data collection include possible under-reporting of concurrency due either to a reluctance of respondents to reveal pre-marital or extra-marital sexual partners or to recall errors. Tabulation of the concurrency indicators is exceedingly complex, and requires some assumptions to be taken. Finally, although the data collected in DHS and AIS surveys can estimate the national prevalence of concurrent sexual partnerships, the data have limited value in analyzing the association between concurrency and HIV transmission. Low numbers of cases of women who report having concurrent sexual partners in DHS and AIS surveys, and the fact that the surveys use a cross-sectional, population-based design limits the analytical value of the concurrency data they collect.},

abstract = {Objectives This study aims to improve the understanding of the relationship between exposure to floods and malnutrition in children aged 6-59 months in rural India. Research has focused exclusively on Bangladeshi children, and few controlled epidemiological studies are available. Method A community-based cross-sectional study of child nutritional status was carried out in 14 flooded and 18 non-flooded villages of Jagatsinghpur district (Orissa) within one month of the September 2008 floods, and similarly affected by flooding in August 2006. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 757 households in the flooded villages and 816 in the non-flooded communities. Data used in this study were from those households with children aged 6-59 months. In total, 191 and 161 children were measured, respectively. The association between various malnutrition indicators and the exposure to floods was assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Adjusted analyses revealed that children in flooded households were more likely stunted compared with those in non-flooded ones (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.60; 95{\%} CI 1.05 to 2.44). The prevalence of underweight was also higher in children living in the flooded communities (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.86; 95{\%} CI 1.04 to 3.30). Further analyses found that the 26-36-month flooded cohort, thus those children younger than 1 year during the precedent flood in August 2006, attained the largest difference in levels of stunting compared with the unexposed group of the same age. Conclusion Exposure to floods is associated with long-term malnutrition in these rural communities of Orissa, India. Children exposed to floods during their first year of life presented higher levels of chronic malnutrition. Long-term malnutrition prevention programmes after floods should be implemented in flood-prone areas.},

abstract = {Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than x-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution. We derive a mean-field variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. The CTM gives a better fit than LDA on a collection of OCRed articles from the journal Science. Furthermore, the CTM provides a natural way of visualizing and exploring this and other unstructured data sets.},

abstract = {Growth stunting, defined as height for age below the fifth percentile on a reference growth curve, is traditionally used as an indicator of nutritional status in children. Growth stunting is a population-based indicator and can indicate the prevalence of malnutrition or nutrition-related disorders among an identified population of children. Among certain segments of the U.S. child population, most notably poor children, growth stunting occurs more often than expected, suggesting that inadequate nutrition may be a problem for these children. Available general population data are not recent enough to allow for an assessment of the impact of several major public programs designed to address the risk of inadequate nutrition among children. Analysis of data from these programs does show, however, a higher-than-expected-albeit-declining level of stunting among program participants. The serious consequences of growth stunting and malnutrition-particularly impaired cognitive development-suggest that careful consideration of the growth stunting indicator should remain an important part of policy discussions on public nutrition programs.},

Four methods for estimating potential evapotranspiration are compared and evaluated. These are the Class A evaporation pan located in an irrigated pasture area, the Hargreaves equation, the Jensen-Haise eguation, and the Blaney-Criddle method. The evaporation pan is rated as superior to the other methods. However, the difference in reliability between the pan and the Hargreaves method are not considered to be very significant. Both the Jensen-Haise and the Hargreaves methods require either measured or estimated solar radiation. Methods are presented for estimating solar radiation from the difference between maximum and minimum temperature, from the percentage of possible sunshine, and from relative humidity. These procedures have some limitations, but provide improved reliability and make the estimates more universal.},

abstract = {Parental education is located at the center of global efforts to improve child health. In a developing-country context, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) plays a crucial role in determining how governments allocate scarce resources to education and public health interventions. Under reforms mandated by IMF structural adjustment programs, it may become harder for parents to reap the benefits of their education due to wage contraction, welfare retrenchment, and generalized social insecurity. This study assesses how the protective effect of education changes under IMF programs, and thus how parents' ability to guard their children's health is affected by structural adjustment. We combine cross-sectional stratified data (countries, 67; children, 1,941,734) from the Demographic and Health Surveys and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. The sample represents ∼2.8 billion (about 50{\%}) of the world's population in year 2000. Based on multilevel models, our findings reveal that programs reduce the protective effect of parental education on child health, especially in rural areas. For instance, in the absence of IMF programs, living in an household with educated parents reduces the odds of child malnourishment by 38{\%} [odds ratio (OR), 0.62; 95{\%} CI, 0.66–0.58]; in the presence of programs, this drops to 21{\%} (OR, 0.79; 95{\%} CI, 0.86–0.74). In other words, the presence of IMF conditionality decreases the protective effect of parents' education on child malnourishment by no less than 17{\%}. We observe similar adverse effects in sanitation, shelter, and health care access (including immunization), but a beneficial effect in countering water deprivation.},

Prevalence-adjusted kappa coefficients showed substantial strength of agreement in two countries. The proportion of agreement between the two scores ranged from 85 {\%} in Lao PDR to 65 {\%} in northern Uganda. Dietary profiles based on food group consumption using score tertiles were comparable. Rankings of the most food-insecure areas within a country corresponded well in northern Uganda and Burkina Faso but not in Lao PDR. Both indicators showed moderate correlations with other proxy measures of food security.Conclusions The comparative study highlights the similarities and differences between the food consumption and household dietary diversity scores. Similar classification of the most food-insecure areas within sub-national levels was obtained. The choice of indicator for food security assessment and surveillance will vary depending on user needs. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.},

Cotton has been dubbed "white gold" by some scholars and the "mother of poverty" by others. A shortcoming of most studies is that cotton is examined in isolation rather than as part of a broader agricultural system. This paper traces the linkages between cotton farming and the development of intensive maize production in Mali using a multi-scale, mixed-method approach. Quantitative analysis of a 15 year data set for over 100 households documents changes in area, production and yields for cotton and grain crops. Semi-formal interviews are used to understand farmer strategies for managing agricultural systems. Results show that cotton yields declined during the study period while maize yields and production increased significantly. We conclude that cotton has been a catalyst in developing intensive agricultural systems as farmers shifted key resources from cotton to maize.},

A case study using Haiti DHS and SPA datasets demonstrates the practical application of linkage to delivery of obstetric services. Individually, the DHS household survey and the SPA facility-based survey are able to answer many relevant questions on access, utilization, and quality of health services. However, being able to link data from the two sources may offer greater insight into 1) how and why individuals access health care and 2) how the type and quality of care at facilities in their service environment can influence care-seeking behavior. The DHS and SPA survey datasets are ideal sources of information on the targeting and impact of health programs. However, for a long time, issues of sampling, geographic data accuracy, access, and operationalization of methodology have prevented effective linkage of DHS and SPA datasets. In 2013, Skiles et al. presented an in-depth methodological study of the issues surrounding geographic displacement of DHS clusters and the sampling of SPA facilities. The work presented here builds on the research carried out by Skiles et al. and outlines specific considerations that need to be examined before linkage of DHS and SPA survey data can take place. The data and linked analyses discussed here may be a starting point for further investigation of care-seeking behaviors, access to health services, and issues of quality of services that require additional quantitative and qualitative study.},

abstract = {Exploiting the principles of biological control of crop pests is an important manage- ment strategy for the resource-poor smallholder farmers of the tropics. The effects of nine hedgerow species on the abundance of major insect pests of beans and maize, and predatory/ parasitic-arthropods were monitored over two cropping seasons and the intervening dry period. The tree/shrub species evaluated were Gliricidia sepium, Grevillea robusta, Senna siamea, Senna spectabilis, Flemingea congesta, Croton megalocarpus, Morus alba, Calliandra calothyrsus and Lantana camara. Arthropod abundance was monitored through counts of infested plants and using yellow pan and pitfall traps. Beanfly (Ophiomyia spp.) infestation was significantly higher in the presence of hedgerows (35{\%}) than in their absence (25{\%}). Hedgerows did not influence aphid (Aphis fabae) infestation of beans. In contrast, maize associated with hedgerows experi- enced significantly lower stalk borer (Busseola fusca and Chilo spp.) and aphid (Rhophalosiphum maidis) infestations than pure maize, the margin of difference being 13{\%} and 11{\%} respectively for the two pests. Ladybird beetles closely followed their prey, aphids, with significantly higher catches in sole cropped-plots than in hedgerow-plots and away from hedgerows. Activity of wasps was significantly greater close to hedgerows than away from them. Spider catches during maize season were 77{\%} greater in the presence of hedgerows than in their absence, but catches during other seasons were similar between the two cropping systems. Differences among hedgerow species were not significant for most of the arthropods monitored, except that beanfly infestation was greater with Gliricidia hedgerows. The study indicates that the effect of hedgerows on pest infestations of crops and their role as refugia for predators cannot be generalized but depends on the specific arthropods.},

abstract = {A general method for constructing low-rank tensor product smooths for use as components of generalized additive models or generalized additive mixed models is presented. A penalized regression approach is adopted in which tensor product smooths of several variables are constructed from smooths of each variable separately, these "marginal" smooths being represented using a low-rank basis with an associated quadratic wiggliness penalty. The smooths offer several advantages: (i) they have one wiggliness penalty per covariate and are hence invariant to linear rescaling of covariates, making them useful when there is no "natural" way to scale covariates relative to each other; (ii) they have a useful tuneable range of smoothness, unlike single-penalty tensor product smooths that are scale invariant; (iii) the relatively low rank of the smooths means that they are computationally efficient; (iv) the penalties on the smooths are easily interpretable in terms of function shape; (v) the smooths can be generated completely automatically from any marginal smoothing bases and associated quadratic penalties, giving the modeler considerable flexibility to choose the basis penalty combination most appropriate to each modeling task; and (vi) the smooths can easily be written as components of a standard linear or generalized linear mixed model, allowing them to be used as components of the rich family of such models implemented in standard software, and to take advantage of the efficient and stable computational methods that have been developed for such models. A small simulation study shows that the methods can compare favorably with recently developed smoothing spline ANOVA methods. {\textcopyright} 2006, The International Biometric Society.},

Changes in land use and land cover considerably alter the Earth's energy balance and biogeochemical cycles, which contributes to climate change and—in turn—affects land surface properties and the provision of ecosystem services1–4. However, quantification of global land change is lacking. Here we analyse 35 years' worth of satellite data and provide a comprehensive record of global land-change dynamics during the period 1982–2016. We show that—contrary to the prevailing view that forest area has declined globally5—tree cover has increased by 2.24 million km2 (+7.1{\%} relative to the 1982 level). This overall net gain is the result of a net loss in the tropics being outweighed by a net gain in the extratropics. Global bare ground cover has decreased by 1.16 million km2 (−3.1{\%}), most notably in agricultural regions in Asia. Of all land changes, 60{\%} are associated with direct human activities and 40{\%} with indirect drivers such as climate change. Land-use change exhibits regional dominance, including tropical deforestation and agricultural expansion, temperate reforestation or afforestation, cropland intensification and urbanization. Consistently across all climate domains, montane systems have gained tree cover and many arid and semi-arid ecosystems have lost vegetation cover. The mapped land changes and the driver attributions reflect a human-dominated Earth system. The dataset we developed may be used to improve the modelling of land-use changes, biogeochemical cycles and vegetation–climate interactions to advance our understanding of global environmental change1–4,6.},

abstract = {The main objective with this study is to investigate how different household characteristics, households' perceptions about the security of land use rights, and the households' proximity to forests affect the individual household's willingness to engage in activities that are meant to promote sustainable forest management in Burkina Faso. To achieve this objective we use a multinomial choice model of engagement (or non-engagement) in forest management activities based on household data from 4 villages surrounding the National Kabore Tambi Park in Burkina Faso. The results show that the participation by household members in forest conservation activities is mainly determined by the three variables that are related to policy: membership in community based forest management associations, security of land use rights, and training. The current training programs focus only on forest conservation practices. To be more efficient it should focus on increasing people's knowledge about the benefits due to conservation and the threats resulting from the lack of forest management. Furthermore the results indicate that improving land use right security would increase farmer's willingness to participate in forest management activities such as community work and forest surveillance. Thus particular attention should be paid to the prevailing system of land rights and its incentives, or disincentives, for promoting sustainable management of the forest resource. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ecosystem resilience depends on functional redundancy (the number of species contributing similarly to an ecosystem function) and response diversity (how functionally similar species respond differently to disturbance). Here, we explore how land-use change impacts these attributes in plant communities, using data from 18 land-use intensity gradients that represent five biomes and {\textgreater} 2800 species. We identify functional groups using multivariate analysis of plant traits which influence ecosystem processes. Functional redundancy is calculated as the species richness within each group, and response diversity as the multivariate within-group dispersion in response trait space, using traits that influence responses to disturbances. Meta-analysis across all datasets showed that land-use intensification significantly reduced both functional redundancy and response diversity, although specific relationships varied considerably among the different land-use gradients. These results indicate that intensified management of ecosystems for resource extraction can increase their vulnerability to future disturbances.},

First, the empirical evidence for plausible and significant impacts of agricultural interventions on defined nutrition outcomes remains disappointingly scarce. Second, absence of evidence should not be equated with evidence of no impact. Weaknesses in study design and survey methods are all too common, leading to weak results and limited generalizability. Third, the broad domains of "agriculture' on the one hand, and "nutritional status' on the other, must be unpackaged in future analyses if statistically significant findings and relevant policy or program conclusions are to be drawn.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Expectations of the potential for nutrition impact of different kinds of investment in agriculture must be set rationally, based on well-defined mechanisms and pathways. Planned and ongoing initiatives aimed at generating such evidence must hold themselves to high standards of both research and communication of findings to appropriate policy audiences globally.},

abstract = {This paper explores the major interactions between the transformation of swidden farming and the pursuit of rural livelihoods in the uplands of Southeast Asia. The paper draws on selected literature, workshop reflections, and six case studies to describe the causal processes and livelihood consequences of swidden change. Householdlevel livelihood responses have included both the intensification and 'dis-intensification' of swidden land-use, the insertion of cash crops, the redeployment of household labour, and the taking on of broader (often non-rural) livelihood aspirations and strategies. At the community level there have been emerging institutional arrangements for management of land and forests, and varying degrees of participation in or resistance to government schemes and programs. Swidden change has led to the loss and also the reassertion, realignment, and redefinition of cultures and identities, with important implications for access to resources. The impacts of these changes have been varied. Cash crops have often improved livelihoods but complete specialisation for the market increases vulnerability. Thus swidden can still provide an important safety net in the face of market fluctuations. Improved access to markets and social provision of education and health care have mostly improved the welfare of previously isolated groups. However, growing differences within and between communities in the course of swidden transformations can leave some groups marginalized and worse off. These processes of differentiation can be accentuated by heavy-handed state interventions based on swidden stereotypes. Nevertheless, communities have not passively accepted these pressures and have mobilized to protect their livelihood assets and strategies. Thus swidden farmers are not resisting appropriate and supportive forms of development. They are adopting new practices and engaging with markets, but in many situations swidden is still important to their livelihood strategies, providing resilience in the face of turbulent change. Active involvement of local people is essential in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating development and conservation programs in swidden lands. Positive market incentives and supportive government policies are better than standardised, top-down directives.},

abstract = {The El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other climate patterns can have profound impacts on the occurrence of infectious diseases ranging from dengue to cholera. In Africa, El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions are associated with increased rainfall in East Africa and decreased rainfall in southern Africa, West Africa, and parts of the Sahel. Because of the key role of water supplies in cholera transmission, a relationship between El Ni{\~{n}}o events and cholera incidence is highly plausible, and previous research has shown a link between ENSO patterns and cholera in Bangladesh. However, there is little systematic evidence for this link in Africa. Using high-resolution mapping techniques, we find that the annual geographic distribution of cholera in Africa from 2000 to 2014 changes dramatically, with the burden shifting to continental East Africa-and away from Madagascar and portions of southern, Central, and West Africa-where almost 50,000 additional cases occur during El Ni{\~{n}}o years. Cholera incidence during El Ni{\~{n}}o years was higher in regions of East Africa with increased rainfall, but incidence was also higher in some areas with decreased rainfall, suggesting a complex relationship between rainfall and cholera incidence. Here, we show clear evidence for a shift in the distribution of cholera incidence throughout Africa in El Ni{\~{n}}o years, likely mediated by El Ni{\~{n}}o's impact on local climatic factors. Knowledge of this relationship between cholera and climate patterns coupled with ENSO forecasting could be used to notify countries in Africa when they are likely to see a major shift in their cholera risk.},

abstract = {Background: Undernutrition is a pervasive condition in Afghanistan, and prevalence is among the highest in the world. We aimed to comprehensively assess district-level geographical disparities and determinants of nutritional status (stunting, wasting, or underweight) among women and children in Afghanistan. Methods: The study used individualised data from the recent Afghanistan National Nutrition Survey 2013. Outcome variables were based on growth and weight anthropometry data, which we analysed linearly as Z scores and as dichotomous categories. We analysed data from a total of almost 14 000 index mother–child pairs using Bayesian spatial and generalised least squares regression models accounting for the complex survey design. Findings: We noted that childhood stunting, underweight, and combined stunting and wasting were consistently highest in districts in Farah, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Kunar, Paktia, and Badakhshan provinces. District prevalence ranged from 4{\%} to 84{\%} for childhood stunting and 5{\%} to 66{\%} for underweight. Child wasting exceeded 20{\%} in central and high-conflict regions that bordered Pakistan including east, southeast, and south. Among mothers, dual burden of underweight and overweight or obesity existed in districts of north, northeast, central, and central highlands (prevalence of 15–20{\%}). Linear growth and weight of children were independently associated with household wealth, maternal literacy, maternal anthropometry, child age, food security, geography, and improved hygiene and sanitation conditions. The mother's body-mass index was determined by many of the same factors, in addition to ethnolinguistic status and parity. Younger mothers ({\textless}20 years old) were more underweight and shorter than older mothers (aged 20–49 years). Interpretation: Afghanistan's rapidly changing political, socioeconomic, and insecurity landscape has both direct and indirect implications on population nutrition. Novel evidence from our study can be used to understand these multifactorial determinants and to identify granular disparities for local level tracking, planning, and implementation of nutritional interventions. Funding: None.},

This paper exploits the timing of monsoon rainfall shocks and the seasonal nature of agriculture to isolate income effects on early childhood anthropometric outcomes in rural Nepal and to provide evidence on the persistence of these effects into later childhood. Findings suggest that a 10 percent increase in rainfall from historic norms during the most recently completed monsoon leads to a 0.15 standard deviation increase in weight-for-age for children ages 0-36 months. This total impact consists of a negative "disease environment effect" of no more than 0.02 standard deviations and a positive "income effect" as high as 0.17 standard deviations. Consistent with this interpretation, excess monsoon rainfall also enhances child stature, but only if the monsoon rainfall shock is experienced in the second year of life. Moreover, this effect on child height is transitory, dissipating completely by age five},

Eligibility of children for questions on health depends on the birth dates given in the birth histories. Both the numerators and the denominators of age-specific fertility rates, infant mortality rates, and other rates depend on reported age. In addition, the quality of the reports of ages and dates reflects on the quality of other information in the surveys.  This assessment is based on virtually all of the surveys of households and surveys of women conducted between 1985-2003 that were available in standard recode format: 102 household surveys and 128 surveys of women, including complete child files from the surveys of women. Incompleteness of reporting, heaping of ages or birth years (stating final digit 0 or 5, or age at death 12 months, for example), and displacement are examined. Results are presented mainly in the form of histograms showing the distribution of indexes of these kinds of problems and lists of surveys that exceed specific thresholds. The effect of displacement on estimates of fertility and infant mortality is explored, as well as evidence that education of the household respondent, household head, and the mother tend to affect misreporting.

A huge amount of data has been collected in West Africa, but these data are typically not analyzed across sectors despite the fact that many sectors overlap and interact with each other. One reason for the lack of multi-sectoral analysis is that it is difficult to combine data from different sources in a meaningful way. In recognition of the need to better utilize existing data, USAID commissioned the development of the West Africa Spatial Analysis Prototype (WASAP). One of the objectives of the WASAP was to develop a Geographic Information System (GIS) for West Africa that could be used to link data from different sources and that would permit analysis at the regional, national, and subnational levels.   One area that would benefit from a multisectoral perspective is the analysis of child nutritional status. Data on the nutritional status of children are typically collected in household surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) implemented by Macro International. Analyses of the factors associated with childhood nutritional status have tended to focus on feeding patterns and socio-economic determinants. However, environmental factors such as climate and agricultural production are also likely to play a role in nutritional status.

The analysis goes beyond the impact of climate on crop yields and provides a multidimensional analysis of vulnerability, while demonstrating the critical role that adaptive capacity has in determining vulnerability. The paper also presents a method for analysing food security vulnerability to climate risks that is replicable at different scales to provide a robust planning tool for policy makers.

abstract = {This report provides an overview of DHS survey questions related to alcohol consumption and an analysis of outcomes from these questions in DHS surveys. It first examines the questions on alcohol use and the response categories in all surveys that included questions about ever, typical, or current alcohol consumption. The inventory found that alcohol questions were included in 65 surveys in 42 developing countries between 1987 and 2014, and 19 different questions related to alcohol consumption were identified. The most common question asked if the respondent had ever drunk alcohol. Responses to this question were used to calculate the prevalence of ever-drinking in 36 surveys. Prevalence varied substantially within and across regions and between men and women. The study then uses multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between alcohol use and unsafe sex in eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa known to have high HIV prevalence. The regression analysis of the global association between self-reported drinking status and unsafe sex was not found to be significant except among men in Zambia, where the odds of engaging in unsafe sex for a current drinker were lower than for a non-drinker (opposite the expected outcome). At the event level, alcohol consumption at last sex was an inconsistent predictor of unsafe sex. For both men and women, the strongest predictor of engaging in unsafe sex was age of respondent?higher odds for those 15-24 compared with those 35 and older. For women, lifetime number of sexual partners also strongly predicted unsafe sex. The authors suggest using validated scales to assess harmful drinking. },

abstract = {This report explores the degree to which contextual factors are determinants of individual behavior, specifically regarding the use of antenatal services. Variation in gender development and empowerment across districts in Nepal suggest that research on women?s antenatal care behaviors may be enhanced by incorporating contextual data at the district level with individual and household level data from the 2001 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). This study of antenatal care uses DHS cluster geocodes to link with contextual data at the district level. The analysis focuses on two outcome measures associated with antenatal care: (a) whether a woman received any antenatal care, and (b) for those women who made at least one antenatal care visit, whether she made four or more visits during the pregnancy. A focus on women?s empowerment and place can direct attention to the study of social contexts and processes, particularly those relating to maternal health behaviors. Many studies of the use of maternal health services have focused on ior micro characteristics. In contrast, this study explores the use of models, specifically hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLM), to investigate whether contextual or macro characteristics also matter. The macro-micro framework postulates that social forces at the macro level determine micro-level opportunities and constraints and thereby influence individual decisions. Policies and programs conceived without consideration for local context and place will have limited impact, unless they are informed by data that appreciates the connection between women?s health and status across different spatial scales and analytical levels.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic land use changes drive a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and modify the transmission of endemic infections. These drivers include agricultural encroachment, deforestation, road construction, dam building, irrigation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, coastal zone degradation, and other activities. These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration. The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges. The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation. Policy-relevant levels of the model include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels. The group recommended creating Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training, based at regional universities and/or research institutes with close links to the surrounding communities. The centers' objectives would be 3-fold: a) to provide information to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health; b) to facilitate fully interdisciplinary research from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences and train professionals who can conduct interdisciplinary research; and c) to engage in science-based communication and assessment for policy making toward sustainable health and ecosystems.},

abstract = {The BUGS language offers a very flexible way of specifying complex statistical models for the purposes of Gibbs sampling, while its JAGS variant offers very convenient R integration via the rjags package. However, including smoothers in JAGS models can involve some quite tedious coding, especially for multivariate or adaptive smoothers. Further, if an additive smooth structure is required then some care is needed, in order to centre smooths appropriately, and to find appropriate starting values. R package mgcv implements a wide range of smoothers, all in a manner appropriate for inclusion in JAGS code, and automates centring and other smooth setup tasks. The purpose of this note is to describe an interface between mgcv and JAGS, based around an R function, jagam, which takes a generalized additive model (GAM) as specified in mgcv and automatically generates the JAGS model code and data required for inference about the model via Gibbs sampling. Although the auto-generated JAGS code can be run as is, the expectation is that the user would wish to modify it in order to add complex stochastic model components readily specified in JAGS. A simple interface is also provided for visualisation and further inference about the estimated smooth components using standard mgcv functionality. The methods described here will be un-necessarily inefficient if all that is required is fully Bayesian inference about a standard GAM, rather than the full flexibility of JAGS. In that case the BayesX package would be more efficient.},

From 2000 to 2011, the unmet need for family planning declined by 10.3 absolute percentage points, from 36.6 percent in 2000 to 26.3 percent in 2011. The results show that there was 38 percent decline in unmet need for limiting and a 21 percent decline in unmet need for spacing. The prevalence of contraceptive use increased substantially from 8 percent in 2000 to nearly 30 percent in 2011. Demand satisfied increased around three-fold from 18 percent from 2000 to 52 percent in 2011. The multivariate analysis indicates that women in rural areas show high levels of unmet need compared with women in urban areas. Among currently married women, DHS survey year, number of living children, women?s current age, age at first marriage, education level, religious affiliation, media exposure to family planning messages, wealth index and residence were significant predictors of unmet need both to limit and space birth.   The unmet need for family planning has decreased significantly in Ethiopia over the last decade.

USAID and Title II implementing partners face challenges in measuring the success of Title II programs in reducing household food insecurity because of the technical difficulty and cost of collecting and analyzing data on traditional food security indicators, such as per capita income and caloric adequacy. The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) holds promise as an easier and more user-friendly approach for measuring the access component of household food security. To support the consistent and comparable collection of the HFIAS, efforts are under way to develop a guide with a standardized questionnaire and data collection and analysis instructions. A set of domains have been identified that is deemed to capture the universal experience of the access component of household food insecurity across countries and cultures. Based on these domains, a set of questions has been developed with wording that is deemed to be universally appropriate, with minor adaptation to local contexts. These underlying suppositions, based on research in multiple countries, are being verified by potential users of the guide. The key remaining issue relates to the process for creating a categorical indicator of food insecurity status from the HFIAS. KEY WORDS: food security food insecurity access measurement indicators},

abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Malnutrition is a challenge to the health and productivity of populations and is viewed as one of the five largest adverse health impacts of climate change. Nonetheless, systematic evidence quantifying these impacts is currently limited. Our aim was to assess the scientific evidence base for the impact of climate change on childhood undernutrition (particularly stunting) in subsistence farmers in low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed and gray full-text documents in English with no limits for year of publication or study design. Fifteen manuscripts were reviewed. Few studies use primary data to investigate the proportion of stunting that can be attributed to climate/weather variability. Although scattered and limited, current evidence suggests a significant but variable link between weather variables, e.g., rainfall, extreme weather events (floods/droughts), seasonality, and temperature, and childhood stunting at the household level (12 of 15 studies, 80{\%}). In addition, we note that agricultural, socioeconomic, and demographic factors at the household and individual levels also play substantial roles in mediating the nutritional impacts. Comparable interdisciplinary studies based on primary data at a household level are urgently required to guide effective adaptation, particularly for rural subsistence farmers. Systemization of data collection at the global level is indispensable and urgent. We need to assimilate data from long-term, high-quality agricultural, environmental, socioeconomic, health, and demographic surveillance systems and develop robust statistical methods to establish and validate causal links, quantify impacts, and make reliable predictions that can guide evidence-based health interventions in the future.},

The measures of quality of care were divided into structure (infrastructure of the facility and availability of commodities), process (provider?s performance), and outcomes (client?s overall satisfaction with services and knowledge of their method?s protection from sexually transmitted infections [STIs]).  Findings revealed that most facilities have the basic infrastructure required (adequate sanitation, improved water, and private examination room). However, some facilities lack electricity, communication equipment, emergency transport, and computer and Internet. Some facilities perform better than others in availability of equipment and diagnostic tests, and some regions outperform others. The presence of several family planning commodities has improved significantly, and the presence of injectables and pills, the two most used methods, remains high, although they are much more likely to be available in public than private facilities. The percentage of providers who offered various forms of counseling was relatively low. New clients were significantly more likely to receive counseling and a high-quality pelvic examination compared with returning clients. Although overall client satisfaction was relatively high (84 percent), only 58 percent of clients had correct knowledge of whether their method protects them from STIs. Counseling had a negative effect on overall client satisfaction and no effect on client?s correct knowledge concerning protection from STIs, indicating a lack of effectiveness of counseling methods. Notably, clients who saw a provider trained in family planning in the last two years significantly increased their odds of having correct knowledge of their method?s protection from STIs. },

abstract = {Objective: To describe the relationship of new measures of hunger and food insecurity to household food supplies and individual food and nutrient intake. Design and Setting: A questionnaire containing the Radimer/Cornell hunger and food insecurity items and questions on eating patterns and the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption was administered to subjects during a personal interview in their homes. A 24-hour diet recall and a household food inventory were conducted at the initial interview and at a follow-up visit. Subjects participants were 193 women drawn from a random sample of 308 women who had completed a previous health census in a rural New York State county. Subjects' ages ranged from 15 to 40 years. All had children living at home and less than 16 years of education. Statistical analyses: Regression analysis was used to test for linear trends across food insecurity groups for the household food inventory scores and for the frequency of consumption of fruits and vegetables. t Tests were used to assess differences between the food secure and food insecure groups for nutrient and food group means. A X2test for trend was used to examine differences in the distribution of nutrient and fruit and vegetable intake between the food secure and food insecure groups. Results: A significant decrease in the frequency of consumption of fruits and vegetables and the amount of food in the household and a significant increase in scores indicative of disordered eating patterns were associated with a worsening of food insecurity status. Potassium and fiber intake and fruit consumption differed significantly between the food secure and food insecure groups. The percentage of respondents consuming less than the Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin C and fewer than five fruits and vegetables per day was significantly greater among food insecure respondents than food secure respondents. Applications/conclusions: The quantity of food available in households and consumption of fruits and vegetables decreased with increasingly severe problems with food insecurity and hunger. In this rural population, the Radimer/Cornell measures were useful in identifying households experiencing food insecurity and providing information about the nature of the food supply and the dietary intake problems experienced by food insecure households and persons, suggesting that these measures may be useful on community surveys designed to examine food insecurity issues.},

abstract = {Unlike many health problems, there are few social and demographic characteristics that define risk groups for intimate partner violence. Poverty is the exception and increases risk through effects on conflict, women's power, and male identity. Violence is used as a strategy in conflict. Relationships full of conflict, and especially those in which conflicts occur about finances, jealousy, and women's gender role transgressions are more violent than peaceful relationships. Heavy alcohol consumption also increases risk of violence. Women who are more empowered educationally, economically, and socially are most protected, but below this high level the relation between empowerment and risk of violence is non-linear. Violence is frequently used to resolve a crisis of male identity, at times caused by poverty or an inability to control women. Risk of violence is greatest in societies where the use of violence in many situations is a socially-accepted norm. Primary preventive interventions should focus on improving the status of women and reducing norms of violence, poverty, and alcohol consumption.},

abstract = {Despite expanding interest in ecosystem service research over the past three decades, in-depth understanding of the contribution of forests and trees to food production and livelihoods remains limited. This review synthesizes the current evidence base examining the contribution of forest and trees to agricultural production and livelihoods in the tropics, where production often occurs within complex land use mosaics that are increasingly subjected to concomitant climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Using systematic review methodology we found 74 studies investigating the effect of forest or tree-based ecosystem service provision on a range of outcomes such as crop yield, biomass, soil fertility, and income. Our findings suggest that when incorporating forests and trees within an appropriate and contextualized natural resource management strategy, there is potential to maintain, and in some cases, enhance yields comparable to solely monoculture systems. Furthermore, this review has illustrated the potential of achieving net livelihood gains through integrating trees on farms, providing rural farmers with additional income sources, and greater resilience strategies to adapt to market or climatic shocks. However, we also identify significant gaps in the current knowledge that demonstrate a need for larger-scale, longer term research to better understand the contribution of forest and trees within the broader landscape and their associated impacts on livelihoods and food production systems.},

abstract = {While progress has been made in many areas of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which expire in 2015, it appears that the maternal, newborn and child health goals (MDG 4 and 5) will not be universally achieved. There was early recognition that it could be possible to achieve the health goals while increasing health inequity, because most of the gains might go to the better-off rather than to the very poor. Concerns about health inequity indicate the need for analysis of health indicators in smaller geographic units, to aid in the identification of hotspots where coverage of key interventions lags behind neighboring areas. This report analyzes the spatial distribution of nine key maternal and child health indicators across 27 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We created maps with 255 polygons representing each survey region from 27 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), joined to indicator estimates. These maps show sub-regional-level autocorrelation for each indicator as well as spatial clusters, and we characterized those clusters in terms of the relationships among neighboring sub-regions. Patterns of substantial differences among contiguous subareas are apparent for different indicators, with some intra-country differences greater than 20 percentage points for all indicators examined. Our analysis shows some cross-border association with groups of high-high or low-low clustering present for all indicators. This analysis facilitates the identification of hotspots of low coverage or high need and can be used to allocate resources effectively to reduce health inequities between and within countries. },

The use of mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) as a screening measure for assessing undernutrition has the following advantages: makes use of simple equipment, is easy to carry to field sites, and requires minimal training. MUAC cutoffs for undernutrition are available for children and adults but not for adolescents. Objective. To compare MUAC with BMI in assessing undernutrition among adolescent girls and to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MUAC as a tool in assessing their nutritional status. Methodology. A total of 565 unmarried adolescent girls of both school-going and non-school-going age (16-18 years old) from the urban slums of Pune city Maharashtra, India, were recruited for the cross-sectional study. Anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, and MUAC were recorded. Results. The percentage of adolescents who were malnourished was 4.8{\%} according to BMI and 5.0{\%} for MUAC. BMI highly correlated with MUAC (r = 0.593), and MUAC as a screening tool showed 28.57{\%} sensitivity and 96.46{\%} specificity. Further studies among different age groups need to be carried out to arrive at standard cutoffs for MUAC.},

abstract = {In this paper we review the associations between maternal and child undernutrition with human capital and risk of adult diseases in low-income and middle-income countries. We analysed data from five long-standing prospective cohort studies from Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa and noted that indices of maternal and child undernutrition (maternal height, birthweight, intrauterine growth restriction, and weight, height, and body-mass index at 2 years according to the new WHO growth standards) were related to adult outcomes (height, schooling, income or assets, offspring birthweight, body-mass index, glucose concentrations, blood pressure). We undertook systematic reviews of studies from low-income and middle-income countries for these outcomes and for indicators related to blood lipids, cardiovascular disease, lung and immune function, cancers, osteoporosis, and mental illness. Undernutrition was strongly associated, both in the review of published work and in new analyses, with shorter adult height, less schooling, reduced economic productivity, and-for women-lower offspring birthweight. Associations with adult disease indicators were not so clear-cut. Increased size at birth and in childhood were positively associated with adult body-mass index and to a lesser extent with blood pressure values, but not with blood glucose concentrations. In our new analyses and in published work, lower birthweight and undernutrition in childhood were risk factors for high glucose concentrations, blood pressure, and harmful lipid profiles once adult body-mass index and height were adjusted for, suggesting that rapid postnatal weight gain-especially after infancy-is linked to these conditions. The review of published works indicates that there is insufficient information about long-term changes in immune function, blood lipids, or osteoporosis indicators. Birthweight is positively associated with lung function and with the incidence of some cancers, and undernutrition could be associated with mental illness. We noted that height-for-age at 2 years was the best predictor of human capital and that undernutrition is associated with lower human capital. We conclude that damage suffered in early life leads to permanent impairment, and might also affect future generations. Its prevention will probably bring about important health, educational, and economic benefits. Chronic diseases are especially common in undernourished children who experience rapid weight gain after infancy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Food security in developing countries depends in part on the sustainable use of natural resources. Food security is usually examined through three dimensions, namely the availability, access, and utilization of food. Ecosystems directly and indirectly support each of these dimensions through the provision of critical ecosystem services that facilitate agricultural production, create income-generating opportunities, and provide energy for cooking. However, in some cases, household uses of natural resources undermine particular elements of food security, hindering national poverty reduction strategies and threatening the sustainability of critical ecosystem functions. I examine the role of ecosystem services in rural food security through the lens of its three dimensions, and highlight the tensions that stem from household-level interactions and uses. In some cases, uses of resources and services that support the access and utilization dimensions may undermine the ecosystem functions that support food availability. The conclusions underscore the importance for the integration of ecosystem services into food security plans and poverty reduction strategies in developing countries. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the authors.},

Most of previous research on the topic has focused to develop theoretical frameworks or to conduct experiments as a means to analyse learning outcomes such as knowledge retention, problem-solving skills gains or attitudes toward game-based learning. Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over the last years. In this study, we use a bibliometric, social network and text mining analysis in order to provide useful up-to-date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. Analysis on a sample of 139 articles published in top journals over the last 5 years (2010–2014) allowed identifying relevant authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. Main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5 years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i) effectiveness, (ii) acceptance, (iii) engagement and (iv) social interactions. Future research lines are also addressed. Lay Description: What is currently known about the use of games in education: Games can increase students' intrinsic motivation to learn. Games support active learning. Games facilitate scaffolded instruction based on each individual student's needs.

abstract = {The global food price crises of 2007–8 and 2010 and subsequent policy debates have led to increased recognition that the drivers of food insecurity and associated policies transcend the boundaries of traditional governmental sectors and jurisdictions. Building on this insight, many governments of countries facing food insecurity have developed, or are in the progress of developing, integrated food security strategies. However, in spite of their recent popularity, to date little is known about the properties and outcomes of these strategies. This paper aims to help overcoming this gap by proposing a way of diagnosing the expected variety of integrated food security strategies and associated outcomes. Three diagnostic steps are put forward, each of which is linked to a specific theoretical perspective from the Public Policy literature. The first step concerns diagnosing the variety of IFSSs and is referred to as descriptive diagnostics. This type of diagnostics is suggested to be performed by using a policy integration perspective. The second step involves diagnosing what causes variety and change. This step is named explanatory diagnostics and revolves around what ‘mechanisms' explain (dis)integration. The third diagnostic step focuses on diagnosing the outcomes of IFSSs and is referred to as evaluatory diagnostics. For this type of diagnostics a policy success and failure perspective is proposed. The applicability of these diagnostic steps and associated theories is illustrated through the case of South Africa's Integrated Food Security Strategy. The paper ends with a discussion of promising methodological approaches and with raising some hypotheses and expectations about performing these types of diagnostics in a Sub-Saharan African context.},

abstract = {This paper studies how aggregate economic conditions affect marriage markets in developing countries where marriage is regulated by traditional customary norms. We examine how local economic shocks influence the timing of marriage, and particularly child marriage, in Sub-Saharan Africa and in India, where substantial monetary or in-kind transfers occur with marriage: bride price across Sub-Saharan Africa and dowry in India. In a simple equilibrium model of the marriage market in which parents choose when their children marry, income shocks affect the age of marriage because marriage payments are a source of consumption smoothing, particularly for a woman's family. As predicted by our model, we show that droughts, which reduce annual crop yields by 10 to 15{\%}, have opposite effects on the marriage behavior of a sample of 400,000 women in the two regions: in Sub-Saharan Africa, they increase the annual hazard into child marriage by 3{\%}, while in India droughts reduce such a hazard by 4{\%}. Changes in the age of marriage due to droughts are associated with changes in fertility, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, and with declines in observed marriage payments. Our results indicate that the age of marriage responds to short-term changes in aggregate economic conditions and that traditional norms determine this response. This suggests that, in order to design successful policies to combat child marriage and improve investments in daughters' human capital, it is crucial to understand the economic role of traditional cultural norms.},

Qualitative contextual information was collected from two village development committees in middle Gorkha District followed by a structured survey of 303 randomly selected households; income data were collected quarterly throughout 2008. Average environmental income was 15.7 {\%} of total household income, ranging from 11.0 to 29.5 {\%}. Environmental reliance decreased with rising income while absolute environmental income increased. Ordinary least square regression analysis indicated that households having large areas of crop and other lands, many livestock, larger amount of bank saving and having at least one migrating household member generate significantly larger amount of total household income. Households having a larger household size and the Dalit households generate significantly lower amount of total household income. Poverty indices and Gini decomposition showed that excluding environmental income from total household income has a large negative impact on the proportion of households below poverty lines, the income shortfall as a proportion of poverty lines and the variation in income distribution among households below the poverty lines.},

abstract = {Cash crop cultivation has been a critical driver of land use change in many countries around the world. However, few efforts have been made to quantify the relationships between cash crop expansion and the subsequent landscape pattern changes. This paper characterized the process of cash crop expansion across Tiaoxi watershed (China) from 1985 to 2009 using multi-sensor and multi-temporal remotely sensed imageries. Correlations were identified between indicators of cash crop expansion (total area and total production of cash crops) and a family of landscape fragmentation metrics (patch density, edge density, landscape division index, effective mesh size, splitting index, Shannon's diversity index, and aggregation index). Results showed that Tiaoxi watershed experienced profound cash crop expansion and progressive landscape fragmentation. The cash crops spread in accessible and productive areas at the expense of paddy and forests. Social drivers of cash crop expansion included population growth, labor structure changes and market incentives. Indicators of cash crop expansion presented linear relationships with landscape fragmentation metrics. These findings evidenced that cash crop cultivation would significantly fragment landscapes. Our study contributed to understanding on the enlarging cultivation of cash crops and the associated modifications of landscape patterns in subtropical regions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {More than three quarters of the world's suicides occur in developing countries, yet little is known about the drivers of suicidal behavior in poor populations. I study India, where one fifth of global suicides occur and suicide rates have doubled since 1980. Using nationally comprehensive panel data over 47 y, I demonstrate that fluctuations in climate, particularly temperature, significantly influence suicide rates. For temperatures above 20◦C, a 1◦C increase in a single day's temperature causes ∼70 suicides, on average. This effect occurs only during India's agricultural growing season, when heat also lowers crop yields. I find no evidence that acclimatization, rising incomes, or other unobserved drivers of adaptation are occurring. I estimate that warming over the last 30 y is responsible for 59,300 suicides in India, accounting for 6.8{\%} of the total upward trend. These results deliver large-scale quantitative evidence linking climate and agricultural income to self-harm in a developing country.},

The review indicates that while there remain concerns about integration, such as degradation of the quality of services, insufficient health system capacity, and financial implications, the balance of the literature finds that clinical, service delivery, cost-effectiveness, and rights-based benefits accrue from integration. This report also presents a descriptive analysis that uses national health facility survey data from the  MEASURE DHS project?s Service Provision Assessment (SPA) surveys to establish an HIV/FP service integration baseline in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have been hard-hit by the HIV epidemic: Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. We highlight areas where integration can be strengthened in line with international recommendations and national policies, and provide recommendations for strengthening health facility survey data collection approaches to ensure optimal monitoring of HIV/FP service delivery integration in the future. Using data from the SPA?s health worker interviews, facility inventories, and client-provider observations, we describe baseline levels of HIV- and FP-related service integration. This report documents considerable disparities between the availability of elements of integrated HIV/FP services, and the actual delivery by a health care provider of ANC or STI services that are fully integrated?where both HIV- and FP-related elements are actually incorporated into the visit.. This report also provides recommendations for adjustments to health facility survey questionnaires that would allow for more complete measurement of HIV/FP service delivery integration. },

abstract = {Kenya began to experience rapid fertility decline in the late 1980s. However, this decline in fertility stalled in the late 1990s. This study examined factors influencing transition to third and fourth births in Kenya for the period between 2003 and 2008/9, in order to provide a better understanding of the current fertility transition in Kenya with respect to birth spacing. Data was obtained from the Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys (KDHS) of 2003 and 2008/9. Logistic regression model was the main method of data analysis. The dependent variable was whether or not a woman had made a transition from second to third birth and from third to fourth birth in the five years preceding each survey. The main independent variables were: education level, place of residence (urban-rural), region of the country, wealth index, marital status, religion, ever-use of contraception, child mortality, and mother?s age at the start of the birth interval.  The results showed that for the five-year period before KDHS 2008/9 the odds of transition to a third birth were lower for women with some education compared with women with no education. Odds were lower for women in Central, Eastern, and North Eastern provinces compared with women in Western province, but higher for women of the Protestant religion compared with Catholic women. The odds of transition to a third birth were lower for women from middle, richer, and richest households compared with women from poorest households, and lower for women who had ever used a modern method of contraception compared with women who had never used contraception. For the five year-period before KDHS 2008/9, the odds of transition from third to a fourth birth were significantly influenced by education level, wealth index, age at the start of the interval, ever-use of contraception, and desire for an additional child. The results for the five year-period before KDHS 2003 showed that transition to fourth birth was significantly associated with region, wealth index, age at the start of the interval, ever-use of contraception, and desire for another child. This paper has two main policy implications. First, there is a need to improve family planning services across the country, which would address the issues of unwanted fertility and unmet need for family planning and hence lead to a decline in fertility. Second, there is also a need to improve the socioeconomic conditions in the country. Higher levels of wealth and education are strongly associated with lower fertility.},

abstract = {Cambodia has achieved remarkable progress in improving maternal and child health in the last few decades. However, little is known about how this progress has been shared among different economic groups. This study uses data from three consecutive Demographic and Health Surveys  conducted in 2000, 2005, and 2010 in Cambodia to assess trends in inequalities for a range of indicators of maternal and child health and health care. The results suggest remarkable improvement in most health and health care indicators between 2000 and 2010 in Cambodia. The increases are universal in the population, from the poorest to the wealthiest. For some indicators?under-five mortality, prevalence of anemia, use of skilled birth attendants, and use of any antenatal care?the absolute percentage point changes between 2000 and 2010 among the poorest quintile of households are at least twice that of the wealthiest quintile. However, substantial inequalities continue to exist between the wealthy and the poor, for most of the indicators studied. Infant mortality and under-five mortality are the least equitable?rates among the poorest quintile are at least three times higher than among the wealthiest. Faster progress in use of health services among the poor than the wealthy in Cambodia would potentially result in more rapid improvement in health among the poor, and eventually could lead to the elimination of inequalities between the poor and the wealthy in maternal and child health status. Intervention programs should focus on the poor but not forget the wealthy segments of the population.},

Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80{\%} of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65{\%} of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.},

abstract = {Background: Nutrition programs frequently approach wasting and stunting as 2 separate conditions with distinct causes and effects. Although several cross-sectional studies have identified an association between the 2 conditions, longitudinal studies are useful to quantify the risk of acute malnutrition based on the trajectory of linear growth. Objective: We analyzed data from a longitudinal study to explore associations between linear growth and relapse to acute malnutrition in high-risk children during the year after recovery from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). Methods: This was a secondary data analysis from a cluster randomized trial involving 1487 Malawian children 6–62 mo old treated for MAM and enrolled upon recovery. Children were followed for 1 y, during which data were collected on anthropometric progress, symptoms of illness, and household food security.Multivariate fixed-effects logistic regression was used to identify associations between linear growth and relapse to acute malnutrition. Results: Children who have recovered from MAM proved to be a high-risk population, with nearly half experiencing a decrease in height-for-age z score (HAZ) for 12 mo. Children whose HAZ was declining were more likely to relapse to MAM or SAM than were those whose linear growth rate maintained or increased their HAZ (P {\textless} 0.001). Mean changes of +0.15, −0.03, −0.17, and −0.53 in HAZ were observed for those who sustained recovery, relapsed to MAM once, relapsed to MAM multiple times, and developed SAM, respectively. Conclusions: Our results add to the body of evidence suggesting that acute wasting is a harbinger of subsequent stunting. Children who experience poor linear growth afterMAMare more likely to experience relapse. Given this bidirectional relation between wasting and stunting, supplementary feeding programs should consider both when designing protocols, aiming to optimize linear growth and achieve acute weight gain, as a means of reducing relapse. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02351687. J Nutr 2018;148:1–6},

Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere.

This study aimed to systematically examine SDM costs in three of the five focus countries where the Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH) and its partners have worked to integrate SDM into family planning programs. The total cost of the SDM integration effort was {\$}916,000 in Guatemala, {\$}671,000 in India/Jharkhand, and {\$}2,718,000 in Rwanda. A unit cost analysis found that, in Guatemala and Rwanda, SDM had substantially lower routine service delivery costs compared with the oral pills, injectables, and condoms. In India, SDM is more costly than orals, but less costly than condoms. SDM becomes even less costly by comparison for those users that continue using beyond the first year. It also compares quite favorably with similar methods in terms of cost per birth averted over a two-year time frame. As for any new method, large-scale integration of SDM into a family planning program takes a substantial amount of time and money, and, in deciding whether to undertake such introduction and scale-up activities, decision makers need to weigh those costs against the individual and societal benefits of expanding method choice. Once SDM is established within family planning programs, it appears to have a similar, or even lower, routine service delivery cost compared with other short-term methods of contraception. },

abstract = {This paper investigates the potential importance of women?s autonomy in the reproductive healthcare-seeking behavior of women in Ethiopia. We hypothesized that women?s autonomy influences their reproductive healthcare-seeking behavior independent of maternal socio-demographic characteristics. We tested this hypothesis using data from the 2005 Ethiopian Demographic and Health survey (EDHS). Women?s autonomy was measured by women?s participation in domestic decision making, attitudes toward wife beating, attitudes toward refusing sex with husband, and whether women said that getting permission to seek medical care is a big problem.   Our analysis shows that women?s autonomy is an important influence on their reproductive healthcare-seeking behavior. Women?s participation in domestic decision making is strongly associated with ever-use of family planning, but not with use of antenatal care, after controlling for socio-demographic factors. In the multivariate model the lack of association between women?s participation in decision making and antenatal care is mediated by factors such as women?s education and place of residence. Women?s attitudes toward refusing sex with husband, an indicator of gender-role attitudes, and the ease of getting permission to seek medical help are significantly associated with both ever-use of contraception and use of antenatal care services, after controlling for the effects of other socio-demographic variables. These findings suggest that women?s autonomy at the household level, including freedom of movement, is important to their use of reproductive health services. Moreover, for both outcome variables, women?s education, paid employment, urban residence, exposure to media, and wealth appear as important predictors. The findings highlight the need in Ethiopia for initiatives to improve women?s autonomy, to attain both gender equality and wider use of health services. Moreover, improving women?s education and employment can play a dual role in enhancing women?s autonomy and healthcare-seeking behavior.},

abstract = {It is controversial if global warming will result into increased crime and conflict rate, and no causal neurobiological mechanisms have been proposed for the putative association between ambient temperature and aggressive behavior. This study shows that during 1996-2013, ambient temperature explained 10{\%} of variance in the violent crime rate in Finland, corresponding to a 1.7{\%} increase/degree centigrade. Ambient temperature also correlated with a one month delay in circannual changes in peripheral serotonin transporter density among both offenders and healthy control subjects, which itself correlated strongly with the monthly violent crime rate. This suggests that rise in temperature modulates serotonergic transmission which may increase impulsivity and general human activity level, resulting into increase in social interaction and risk of violent incidents. Together, these results suggest that the effect of ambient temperature on occurrence of violent crime is partly mediated through the serotonergic system, and that a 2 °C increase in average temperatures would increase violent crime rates by more than 3{\%} in non-tropical and non-subtropical areas, if other contributing factors remained constant.},

In five countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), we analyze the effect of HIV testing during antenatal care on adoption of contraception following birth. In two of the countries (Lesotho and Zimbabwe), we also examine (a) adoption and (b) discontinuation of contraception among women who did not experience a birth in the past 24 months and for whom the option of an HIV test occurs outside of the context of antenatal care. We use longitudinal contraceptive calendar data to estimate hazard models of a change in contraceptive behavior, using as covariates (1) HIV status as determined by biomarker testing at the time of the survey and (2) women?s self-reported HIV testing experience. In Kenya only, HIV-positive women have a longer duration to adopting contraception following birth compared with HIV-negative women. This relationship is not found elsewhere, nor is HIV status associated with the hazard of adopting or discontinuing contraception among women without a birth in the past 24 months. In Lesotho, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, women who receive HIV test results during antenatal care have a shorter expected time to adopting contraception, regardless of HIV status, but not in Kenya or Malawi. Among women without a birth in the past 24 months, those who receive HIV test results have a shorter expected time to adopting contraception in Zimbabwe, but there is no statistical difference in Lesotho.

abstract = {We reviewed interventions that affect maternal and child undernutrition and nutrition-related outcomes. These interventions included promotion of breastfeeding; strategies to promote complementary feeding, with or without provision of food supplements; micronutrient interventions; general supportive strategies to improve family and community nutrition; and reduction of disease burden (promotion of handwashing and strategies to reduce the burden of malaria in pregnancy). We showed that although strategies for breastfeeding promotion have a large effect on survival, their effect on stunting is small. In populations with sufficient food, education about complementary feeding increased height-for-age Z score by 0{\textperiodcentered}25 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}01-0{\textperiodcentered}49), whereas provision of food supplements (with or without education) in populations with insufficient food increased the height-for-age Z score by 0{\textperiodcentered}41 (0{\textperiodcentered}05-0{\textperiodcentered}76). Management of severe acute malnutrition according to WHO guidelines reduced the case-fatality rate by 55{\%} (risk ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}45, 0{\textperiodcentered}32-0{\textperiodcentered}62), and recent studies suggest that newer commodities, such as ready-to-use therapeutic foods, can be used to manage severe acute malnutrition in community settings. Effective micronutrient interventions for pregnant women included supplementation with iron folate (which increased haemoglobin at term by 12 g/L, 2{\textperiodcentered}93-21{\textperiodcentered}07) and micronutrients (which reduced the risk of low birthweight at term by 16{\%} (relative risk 0{\textperiodcentered}84, 0{\textperiodcentered}74-0{\textperiodcentered}95). Recommended micronutrient interventions for children included strategies for supplementation of vitamin A (in the neonatal period and late infancy), preventive zinc supplements, iron supplements for children in areas where malaria is not endemic, and universal promotion of iodised salt. We used a cohort model to assess the potential effect of these interventions on mothers and children in the 36 countries that have 90{\%} of children with stunted linear growth. The model showed that existing interventions that were designed to improve nutrition and prevent related disease could reduce stunting at 36 months by 36{\%}; mortality between birth and 36 months by about 25{\%}; and disability-adjusted life-years associated with stunting, severe wasting, intrauterine growth restriction, and micronutrient deficiencies by about 25{\%}. To eliminate stunting in the longer term, these interventions should be supplemented by improvements in the underlying determinants of undernutrition, such as poverty, poor education, disease burden, and lack of women's empowerment. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Doraiswamy2007,
abstract = {Agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa is a low-input low-output system primarily for subsistence. Some of these areas are becoming less able to feed the people because of land degradation and erosion. The aim of this study is to characterize the potential for increasing levels of soil carbon for improving soil quality and carbon sequestration. A combination of high- and low-resolution imagery was used to develop a land use classification for an area of 64 km2 near Omarobougou, Mali. Field sizes were generally small (10-50 ha), and the primary cultivation systems are conventional tillage and ridge tillage, where tillage is performed by a combination of hand tools and animal-drawn plows. Based on land use classification, climate variables, soil texture, in situ soil carbon concentrations, and crop growth characteristics, the EPIC-Century model was used to project the amounts of soil carbon sequestered for the region. Under the usual management practices in Mali, mean crop yield reported (1985-2000) for maize is 1.53 T ha-1, cotton is 1.2 T ha-1, millet is 0.95 T ha-1, and for sorghum is 0.95 T ha-1. Year-to-year variations can be attributed to primarily rainfall, the amount of plant available water, and the amount of fertilizer applied. Under continuous conventional cultivation, with minimal fertilization and no residue management, the soil top layer was continuously lost due to erosion, losing between 1.1 and 1.7 Mg C ha-1 over 25 years. The model projections suggest that soil erosion is controlled and that soil carbon sequestration is enhanced with a ridge tillage system, because of increased water infiltration. The combination of modeling with the land use classification was used to calculate that about 54 kg C ha-1 year-1 may be sequestered for the study area with ridge tillage, increased application of fertilizers, and residue management. This is about one-third the proposed rate used in large-scale estimates of carbon sequestration potential in West Africa, because of the mixture of land use practices. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {In Ethiopia, the levels of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity are among the highest in the world. The maternal mortality rate in 2000 was 816 per 100,000 live births, and the infant mortality rate was 113 per 1,000. One explanation for poor health outcomes among women and children is the nonuse of modern health care services by a sizable proportion of women in Ethiopia. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that the utilization of available maternal health services is very low in the country. Several studies in the 1990s have shown that about 25 percent of Ethiopian women received antenatal care and less than 10 percent received professionally assisted delivery care.  Despite the fact that maternal health care utilization is essential for further improvement of maternal and child health, little is known about the current magnitude of use and factors influencing the use of these services in Ethiopia. This paper therefore aims to fill this gap using data from the 2000 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The purpose of this study is to understand the current status of utilization of maternal health services in Ethiopia by elucidating the various factors influencing the use of these services in the country. It is hoped that the results of the study will improve policymakers? understanding of the determinants of maternal and child mortality and morbidity in the country and serve as an important tool for any possible intervention aimed at improving the low utilization of maternity care services in the country.},

abstract = {The study describes patterns of premarital fertility in 25 countries from sub-Saharan Africa. Premarital fertility is defined as giving birth before a woman?s first marriage, whether formal or informal. Data were taken from 43 DHS and related surveys. On average in the selected countries, about one woman out of five experiences a premarital birth. Prevalence of premarital fertility varies markedly by country (from 2.4{\%} to 60.2{\%}), and even more by ethnic group (from 0.1{\%} to 76.2{\%}). Premarital fertility is the result of a complex process, influenced by age at first marriage, age at first intercourse, contraceptive use and cultural factors, which all vary by ethnicity. An analysis of 263 ethnic groups shows that age at first marriage is by far the most important of these factors. In addition, factors linked to modernization and religion also have an influence on the prevalence of premarital fertility: urbanization, modern education, wealth and being Christian have a positive correlation with premarital fertility, whereas being Muslim or in a polygamous union have negative correlations. However, even taking into account demographic and socioeconomic factors, the variance of premarital fertility remained high, showing the effect of cultural factors. The demographic evidence presented in this analysis appeared consistent with the ethnographic record, which distinguishes between repressive and permissive societies.

abstract = {There has been growing policy interest in social justice issues related to both health and food. We sought to understand the state of knowledge on relationships between health equity--i.e. health inequalities that are socially produced--and food systems, where the concepts of 'food security' and 'food sovereignty' are prominent. We undertook exploratory scoping and mapping stages of a 'meta-narrative synthesis' on pathways from global food systems to health equity outcomes. The review was oriented by a conceptual framework delineating eight pathways to health (in)equity through the food system: 1--Multi-Scalar Environmental, Social Context; 2--Occupational Exposures; 3--Environmental Change; 4--Traditional Livelihoods, Cultural Continuity; 5--Intake of Contaminants; 6--Nutrition; 7--Social Determinants of Health and 8--Political, Economic and Regulatory context. The terms 'food security' and 'food sovereignty' were, respectively, paired with a series of health equity-related terms. Combinations of health equity and food security (1414 citations) greatly outnumbered pairings with food sovereignty (18 citations). Prominent crosscutting themes that were observed included climate change, biotechnology, gender, racialization, indigeneity, poverty, citizenship and HIV as well as institutional barriers to reducing health inequities in the food system. The literature indicates that food sovereignty-based approaches to health in specific contexts, such as advancing healthy school food systems, promoting soil fertility, gender equity and nutrition, and addressing structural racism, can complement the longer-term socio-political restructuring processes that health equity requires. Our conceptual model offers a useful starting point for identifying interventions with strong potential to promote health equity. A research agenda to explore project-based interventions in the food system along these pathways can support the identification of ways to strengthen both food sovereignty and health equity.},

abstract = {Ecosystem values are not well accounted for in decisions concerning natural resources. In this context, the concept of ecosystem services offers an important opportunity to develop a framework to underpin the wise use of biodiversity and other natural resources. Although the merit of using ecosystem services to frame biodiversity evaluations has been documented, the classification systems employed mix processes (means) for achieving services and the services themselves (ends) within the same classification category. This limits their contribution to decisions concerning biodiversity. Ambiguity in the definitions of key terms - such as ecosystem processes, functions and services - exacerbates this situation. After clarifying definitions and discussing the basic components of an effective typology, this paper develops a classification of ecosystem services that provides a framework for decisions in natural resource management. However, further work is still required to resolve particular issues, such as the classification of socio-cultural services. Although science can contribute to effective decisions by clearly classifying services and describing their links to processes, final decisions concerning biodiversity and other natural resources are inevitably socio-political, and embedded within a particular cultural context.

Using high-frequency panel data from northern Ethiopia, this study attempts to quantify seasonal fluctuations in children's weights. Consistent with earlier studies, we document considerable seasonality in children's age and height adjusted weights. While children located closer to local food markets are better nourished compared to their counterparts residing farther away, their weights are also subject to considerable seasonality. Further analysis shows that children located closer to food markets consume more diverse diets than those located farther away but the content of the diet varies across seasons. This leads us to conclude that households located near these food markets are not able to insulate their children from seasonal weight fluctuations. We discuss some policy options with potential to address this threat to child wellbeing.},

abstract = {Shea trees (Vitellaria paradoxa, synonym: Butyrospermum paradoxum or parkii) have been botanically recorded in 21 countries across semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa. Dried kernels are the source of shea butter, a stearic/oleic rich edible oil or fat consumed locally, and internationally as an ingredient in the multi-billion dollar cosmetic and confectionary sectors. For millennia shea has been a staple edible oil crop, significantly contributing to nutritional health, livelihoods and the community well-being of women collectors and their families. This research is the first known attempt to predict the potential shea distribution and production using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) by combining binary and suitability layers developed from eight parameters: land-use, temperature, precipitation, elevation, fire, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil-type and soil-drainage. The model is verified and validated using 302 GPS coordinates of shea trees and distributions developed by USAID West Africa Trade Hub (WATH). The model gives an extensive shea tree suitability area of 3.41 million km2across 23 countries with rural population of 112 million, including 18.4 million women collectors. Using conservative estimates, 1.84 billion trees (1.07 billion in high stearin areas) are predicted. Given current population densities, a collected crop of 2.44 million tons of kernels yielding greater than 800 thousand tons of shea butter is estimated (1.63 million tons high stearin kernel). As scientific knowledge on shea expands, the model's suitability criteria can be fine-tuned and climate change, development and urbanization impacts estimated. The suitability model developed is thus useful to governments, non-government organizations, researchers, and industry in planning projects and investments in rural development, climate change, food security and biodiversity through shea production.},

In order for people to use such models, however, they must trust them. Un-fortunately, typical dimensionality reduction methods for text, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, often produce low-dimensional sub- spaces (topics) that are obviously flawed to human domain experts. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) An analysis of the ways in which topics can be flawed; (2) an automated evaluation metric for identifying such topics that does not rely on human annotators or reference collections outside the training data; (3) a novel statistical topic model based on this metric that significantly improves topic quality in a large-scale document collection from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).},

abstract = {Low mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC), determined on the basis of a fixed cut-off value, has commonly been used as a proxy for low weight-for-height (wasting). The use of a fixed cut-off value was based on the observation that MUAC showed small age- and sex-specific differences. However, in 1993, a WHO Expert Committee concluded that age independence is not reflected in the true pattern of mid-upper arm growth, recommended the use of MUAC-for-age, and presented age- and sex-specific MUAC reference data developed with observations obtained from a representative sample of children in the USA aged 6-59 months. In this article, we explain the methodology for the development of these data, present age- and sex-specific growth curves and tables and discuss the applications and limitations of MUAC as a nutritional indicator. To develop the reference data, estimates were first obtained for the mean and standard deviation of MUAC for each month of age using 7-month segmental regression equations; a 5th-degree and a 3rd-degree polynomial in age was then used to describe the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of MUAC-for age. These curves show important age-specific differences, and significant sex-specific differences for boys and girls {\textless} 24 months of age. Correct interpretation of MUAC with regard to nutritional status requires the use of MUAC-for-age reference data such as those presented here.},

abstract = {This study develops a novel approach for projecting climate trends in the Sahel in relation to shifting livelihood zones and health outcomes. Focusing on Mali, we explore baseline relationships between temperature, precipitation, livelihood, and malnutrition in 407 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) clusters with a total of 14,238 children, resulting in a thorough spatial analysis of coupled climate-health dynamics. Results suggest links between livelihoods and each measure of malnutrition, as well as a link between climate and stunting. A 'front-line' of vulnerability, related to the transition between agricultural and pastoral livelihoods, is identified as an area where mitigation efforts might be usefully targeted. Additionally, climate is projected to 2025 for the Sahel, and demographic trends are introduced to explore how the intersection of climate and demographics may shift the vulnerability 'front-line', potentially exposing an additional 6 million people in Mali, up to a million of them children, to heightened risk of malnutrition from climate and livelihood changes. Results indicate that, holding constant morbidity levels, approximately one quarter of a million children will suffer stunting, nearly two hundred thousand will be malnourished, and over one hundred thousand will become anemic in this expanding arid zone by 2025. Climate and health research conducted at finer spatial scales and within shorter projected time lines can identify vulnerability hot spots that are of the highest priority for adaptation interventions; such an analysis can also identify areas with similar characteristics that may be at heightened risk. Such meso-scale coupled human-environment research may facilitate appropriate policy interventions strategically located beyond today's vulnerability front-line. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Investing in nutrition is our collective legacy for a sustainable world in 2030. The Global Nutrition Report confirms the urgency of collective action to combat malnutrition's cascading impact on peo-ple, communities, and whole societies. The simple truth is we cannot secure sustainable development until we address the persistent food and nutrition challenges undermining opportunities for our planet's poorest and most vulnerable people.

abstract = {Environmental degradation resulting from long-term drought and land use change has affected terrestrial carbon (C) stocks within Africa's Sahel. We estimated Senegal's terrestrial carbon stocks in 1965, 1985, and 2000 using an inventory procedure involving satellite images revealing historical land use change, and recent field measurements of standing carbon stocks occurring in soil and plants. Senegal was divided into eight ecological zones containing 11 land uses. In 2000, savannas, cultivated lands, forests, and steppes were the four largest land uses in Senegal, occupying 70, 22, 2.7, and 2.3 percent of Senegal's 199,823km2. System C stocks ranged from 9tCha-1 in degraded savannas in the north, to 113tCha-1 in the remnant forests of the Senegal River Valley. This approach resulted in estimated total C stocks of 1019 and 727MTC between 1965 and 2000, respectively, indicating a loss of 292MTC over 35 years. The proportion of C residing in biomass decreased with time, from 55 percent in 1965 to 38 percent in 2000. Calculated terrestrial C flux for 1993 was -7.5MTCyear-1 and had declined by 17 percent over the previous 18 years. Most of the terrestrial C flux in 1993 was attributed to biomass C reduction. Human disturbance accounted for only 22 percent of biomass C loss in 1993, suggesting that the effects of long-term Sahelian drought continue to play an overriding role in ecosystem change. Some carbon mitigation strategies for Senegal were investigated, including potential C sequestration levels. Opportunities for C mitigation exist but are constrained by available knowledge and access to resources. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Combining crop plants with other plant species in agro-ecosystems is one way to enhance ecological pest and disease regulation mechanisms. Resource availability and microclimatic variation mechanisms affect processes related to pest and pathogen life cycles. These mechanisms are supported both by empirical research and by epidemiological models, yet their relative importance in a real complex agro-ecosystem is still not known. Our aim was thus to assess the independent effects and the relative importance of different variables related to resource availability and microclimatic variation that explain pest and disease occurrence at the plot scale in real complex agro-ecosystems. The study was conducted in cacao (Theobroma cacao) agroforests in Cameroon, where cocoa production is mainly impacted by the mirid bug, Sahlbergella singularis, and black pod disease, caused by Phytophthora megakarya. Vegetation composition and spatial structure, resource availability and pest and disease occurrence were characterized in 20 real agroforest plots. Hierarchical partitioning was used to identify the causal variables that explain mirid density and black pod prevalence. The results of this study show that cacao agroforests can be differentiated on the basis of vegetation composition and spatial structure. This original approach revealed that mirid density decreased when a minimum number of randomly distributed forest trees were present compared with the aggregated distribution of forest trees, or when forest tree density was low. Moreover, a decrease in mirid density was also related to decreased availability of sensitive tissue, independently of the effect of forest tree structure. Contrary to expectations, black pod prevalence decreased with increasing cacao tree abundance. By revealing the effects of vegetation composition and spatial structure on mirids and black pod, this study opens new perspectives for the joint agro-ecological management of cacao pests and diseases at the plot scale, through the optimization of the spatial structure and composition of the vegetation.},

There is growing evidence of the connections between slow growth in height early in life and impaired health and educational and economic performance later in life. Recent research findings, including follow-up of an intervention trial in Guatemala, indicate that stunting can have long-term effects on cognitive development, school achievement, economic productivity in adulthood and maternal reproductive outcomes. This evidence has contributed to the growing scientific consensus that tackling childhood stunting is a high priority for reducing the global burden of disease and for fostering economic development. Follow-up of randomized intervention trials is needed in other regions to add to the findings of the Guatemala trial. Further research is also needed to: understand the pathways by which prevention of stunting can have long-term effects; identify the pathways through which the non-genetic transmission of nutritional effects is mediated in future generations; and determine the impact of interventions focused on linear growth in early life on chronic disease risk in adulthood. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Growing evidence demonstrates that climatic conditions can have a profound impact on the functioning of modern human societies1,2 , but effects on economic activity appear inconsistent. Fundamental productive elements of modern economies, such as workers and crops, exhibit highly non-linear responses to local temperature even in wealthy countries3,4 . In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature5 , while poor countries respond only linearly5,6 . Resolving this conflict between micro and macro observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled human–natural systems7,8 and to anticipating the global impact of climate change9,10 . Here we unify these see- mingly contradictory results by accounting for non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is non- linear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13 6C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960, and apparent for agricultural and non-agri- cultural activity in both rich and poor countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical founda- tion for modelling economic loss in response to climate change11,12 , with important implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23{\%} by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios with- out climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate.},

abstract = {This study investigates levels and trends in modern contraceptive use among married women in Malawi and explores differences by socio-demographic characteristics. The study uses panel data from the 2000, 2004, and 2010 Malawi Demographic Health Surveys (MDHS), employing multinomial logistic regression. Background variables include the characteristics of women, such as education, urban-rural residence, age, marital status, household wealth, and access to media. In addition, the study explores differences by fertility indicators, including number of children born, desire for more children, and ideal family size.  Modern contraceptive use among married women in Malawi changed little between 2000 and 2004 but increased considerably between 2004 and 2010, from 26{\%} to 42{\%}. Modern contraceptive use remains higher among married women with more education, women in wealthier households, and women with more access to media, although women in most categories have shown increases in contraceptive use. For example, modern contraceptive use among women in rural areas increased from 27{\%} in 2004 to 39{\%}in 2009, compared with an increase among urban women from 35{\%} to 46{\%} over the same period. The study found that number of living children was significantly associated with modern contraceptive use in all three surveys. Also, women who reported that they wanted to have another child and those who were uncertain about childbearing were significantly more likely to use modern contraception in 2004 and 2010 compared with 2000. Among women who wanted no more children, contraceptive use increased significantly in 2010 compared with 2000. Increased contraceptive use among women who want no more children and women with high parity indicate that a growing percentage of women want to limit and space childbearing. Thus making effective and long-acting contraceptive methods more available would help many women attain their desired fertility goals. At the same time, the strong association between women?s education and modern contraceptive use identified in the study suggests that considerable progress has been achieved in women?s education in Malawi, which may have contributed to increases in contraceptive use.},

abstract = {Pollinators contribute around 10{\%} of the economic value of crop production globally, but the contribution of these pollinators to human nutrition is potentially much higher. Crops vary in the degree to which they benefit from pollinators, and many of the most pollinator-dependent crops are also among the richest in micronutrients essential to human health. This study examines regional differences in the pollinator dependence of crop micronutrient content and reveals overlaps between this dependency and the severity of micronutrient deficiency in people around the world. As much as 50{\%} of the production of plant-derived sources of vitamin A requires pollination throughout much of Southeast Asia, whereas other essential micronutrients such as iron and folate have lower dependencies, scattered throughout Africa, Asia and Central America. Micronutrient deficiencies are three times as likely to occur in areas of highest pollination dependence for vitamin A and iron, suggesting that disruptions in pollination could have serious implications for the accessibility of micronutrients for public health. These regions of high nutritional vulnerability are understudied in the pollination literature, and should be priority areas for research related to ecosystem services and human well-being.},

A logistic regression model was utilized to analyze factors that influenced worker households to engage in NTFPs business activities. The study found the following: NTFPs collection activities had become the primary NTFPs business activity engaged in by the worker households in the forest areas of Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling Mountains because of the relatively small investment needed as well as fewer production and operating risks. The engagement of worker households in the forest areas of Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling Mountains in NTFPs business activities was still in a preliminary stage. Whether or not worker households engaged in NTFPs business activities was not affected by household head or household manpower characteristics; rather, worker households were more willing to engage in NTFPs business activities when the households had bank deposits, homes were close to the woodlands, the woodlands had good quality soil, and the households received social services.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-based management requires the promotion and integration of locally relevant ecosystem services. This needs an understanding of which ecosystem services local people value and how local valuation varies with socio-cultural and market factors. We convened ten focus group discussions and performed 105 household surveys from major indigenous groups and recent settlers about local values of various forest-based ecosystem services in changing landscapes of southwest Ethiopia. We found that the extent of ecosystem service use and assessment depends on sociocultural background and gender of the informants, as well as income and cultural contributions of these services. Ecosystem service values vary in space and time where local people reported that they increasingly value services as they become scarce or in response to increased demands due to emerging markets or changes in production systems. Local people mostly appreciated a few services of high market value while most ecosystem services are not traded in local markets and hence not highly valued. Some low-rated ecosystem services such as fodder and medicinal plants were nonetheless widely used demonstrating the need to also conserve low rated ecosystem services that are used universally. We suggest promoting socio-cultural and other non-marketable ecosystem services to reduce the over-exploitation or exclusion of specific biodiversity components in conservation activities.},

abstract = {The runoff generated from mountainous regions is recognized as the main water source for inland river basins in arid environments. Thus, the mechanisms by which catchments retain water in soils are to be understood. The water storage capacity of soil depends on its depth and capacity to retain water under gravitational drainage and evapotranspiration. The latter can be studied through soil water retention curve (SWRC), which is closely related to soil properties such as texture, bulk density, porosity, soil organic carbon content, and so on. The present study represented SWRCs using HYDRUS-1D. In the present study, we measured physical and hydraulic properties of soil samples collected from Sabina przewalskii forest (south-facing slope with highest solar radiation), shrubs (west-facing slope with medium radiation), and Picea crassifolia forest (north-facing slope with lowest radiation), and analyzed the differences in soil water storage capacity of these soil samples. Soil water content of those three vegetation covers were also measured to validate the soil water storage capacity and to analyze the relationship between soil organic matter content and soil water content. Statistical analysis showed that different vegetation covers could lead to different soil bulk densities and differences in soil water retention on the three slope aspects. Sand content, porosity, and organic carbon content of the P. crassifolia forest were relatively greater compared with those of the S. przewalskii forest and shrubs. However, silt content and soil bulk density were relatively smaller than those in the S. przewalskii forest and shrubs. In addition, there was a significant linear positive relationship between averaged soil water content and soil organic matter content (P{\textless}0.0001). However, this relationship is not significant in the P. crassifolia forest. As depicted in the SWRCs, the water storage capacity of the soil was 39.14{\%} and 37.38{\%} higher in the P. crassifolia forest than in the S. przewalskii forest and shrubs, respectively, at a similar soil depth.},

However, studies on the importance of NTFPs to rural communities are often limited to a few select sites and are conducted in areas that are already known to have high rates of NTFP use. To address this, we examined the role of geographic and household level variables in determining whether a household would report collecting wild foods and other nonfood NTFP across 25 agro-ecological landscapes in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Ghana. The aim of this study was to contribute to the literature on NTFP collection in Africa and to better understand where people depend on these resources by drawing on a broad range of sites that were highly variable in geographic characteristics as well as rates of NTFP collection to provide a better understanding of the determinants of NTFP collection. We found that geographic factors, such as the presence of forests, non-forest natural areas like grasslands and shrublands, and lower population density significantly predict whether a household will report collecting NTFP, and that these factors have greater explanatory power than household characteristics},

This paper reviews the contributions of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program to the data needs of youth programs worldwide and examines constraints and challenges to meeting the increased demand for youth data. The DHS Program collects information on three youth age groups (15-19, 20-24, and 25-29). Key measures focus on sexual and reproductive health (e.g., awareness of HIV and HIV prevention), education, and poverty. Many DHS surveys include a special module on young women?s experience of domestic violence. Expanding youth-focused data collection in DHS surveys would involve (1) adapting the age range in surveys to include respondents under age 15 (i.e., age 10-14) and/or (2) modifying the content of the DHS core questionnaire to accommodate additional questions relevant to youth. There are serious constraints and challenges to implementing either of these strategies. Interviewing youth age 10-14 in DHS surveys would require the integration of specialized, in-depth or qualitative data collection approaches with the program?s standard interview methodology. This would necessitate substantial changes to DHS samples and add to the existing burdens of staff during training and fieldwork. Adding more youth-relevant questions to the DHS core questionnaire would be more feasible but DHS interviews are already lengthy and the number of additional questions would be severely limited. DHS will continue seeking ways to meet the increasing need for quality data on youth. },

abstract = {The notion of food security has an important history as a key concept for 20th-century policymakers. Two overarching perspectives on food security are identified. One centred on raising production as the core answer to under-consumption and hunger. The other is an emerging perspective, more social and ecological, accepting the need to address a complex array of problems, not just production. The first is primarily agricultural-focused; the latter a food systems approach. From its inception in post-World War 2 international reconstruction, the UN and governments have given tackling hunger a high profile, via a changing package of policy measures. Within a few decades, the production-oriented approach or paradigm was being questioned by the emerging paradigm with its more complex, multi-focused notion of the challenges ahead. When oil and agricultural commodity prices spiked in 2007-8, the complex agenda was marginalised by a renewed international focus on primary production and the needs of low-income countries. Against this background, the paper explores the diversity of perspectives on what is meant by food security, concluding that the core 21st-century task is to create a sustainable food system. This requires a more coherent policy framework than currently exists, a goal thwarted by competing solutions vying for policy attention and policy failure thus far to integrate the complex range of evidence from social as well as environmental and economic sources into an integrated policy response. {\textcopyright} 2012 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).},

The expansion occurred in several areas, but especially within economics, indicating that heights are now widely accepted as useful measure of human welfare. Much of this new work extends beyond the traditional bailiwick of anthropometric history, including biological welfare during economic and political crises; anthropometric determinants of wages; the welfare of women relative to men in the contemporary world; the fetal origins hypothesis; and inequality in the developing world. The approach has also expanded within economic history to consider the consequences of empire for colonials; the health of populations lacking traditional measures of social performance; the consequences of smallpox; and very long-term trends in health. Much has also been learned about socioeconomic aspects of inequality, the welfare implications of industrialization, and socioeconomic determinants of stature.

abstract = {Common agricultural practice in West Africa involves alternating crop cultivation for 10-12 years and thereafter leaving the field to rest (fallow) for 10-15 years. With increasing population pressure and growing demand for food on the one hand, and the lack of unexploited lands on the other, soils undergo fast degradation. In an attempt to predict soil degradation, 12 fields were sampled around Kita, Mali. Seven of these fields were under cultivation whereas the remaining fields were fallow or virgin soils. The soil pH, electrical conductivity, N-NO3, N-NH4, P, K, and the soil organic matter (SOM) were determined. Of all variables, only nitrogen and SOM showed significant linear relationship with cotton lint at the cultivated fields, with SOM being the only variable showing a clear threshold (of 18 t/ha) that distinguishes between fertile and infertile fields. Based on field observations a simple model of the family agricultural land use is presented, aiming to provide a link between agriculture practice and soil degradation. The model demonstrates that the current practices of cultivation and fertilization will result in a slow but inevitable decrease of SOM, with SOM reaching, in 25-35 years, a critical level, below which cotton growth will no longer be economical. We thus conclude that the current practice of cultivation is inefficient and a new cultivation practice, which accounts for the cardinal role of SOM should be adopted. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Real time monitoring of vegetation conditions is of paramount
importance, particularly for food insecure countries, to detect possible
crop and pastures production drops as early as possible. This monitoring
is classically based on remote sensing indicators of vegetation
conditions (typically NDVI and rainfall produced every ten days at a
resolution of 1 km or more) and many web portals now offer anomaly maps
and time profiles derived from these indicators; however, timely and
coherent interpretation of this coarse resolution information at global
scale remains challenging. With the ASAP system (Anomaly hot Spots of
Agricultural Production) we propose a two-step analysis to provide every
month warning of production deficits in water limited agricultural
systems. The first step is fully automated and classifies each Gaul 1
unit (i.e. first sub-national administrative level) according to a
warning scale. These warnings are triggered only during the crop/pasture
growing season, as derived from a remote sensing based phenology. For
each Gaul 1 unit, the classification takes into consideration its
fraction of agricultural area affected by a severe anomaly for two
rainfall-based indicators and one biomass indicator, as well as timing
in the crop cycle at which the anomaly occurs. In the second step,
agricultural analysts check the automatic warnings to identify the
countries which qualify as ``hot spot{\{}''{\}} because of their potentially
critical conditions. The system elaborates the warnings for the whole
globe but the analysts focus on 80 food insecure countries in Africa,
Asia and America. In their evaluation, the analysts are assisted by
graphs and maps automatically generated in the first step, agriculture
and food security-tailored media analysis and high resolution imagery
(e.g. Landsat 8, Sentinel 1 and 2) processed with Google Earth Engine.
Maps and statistics, accompanied by short narratives are then published
on the website and can be used directly by food security analysts with
no expertise in crop monitoring with remote sensing, or can contribute
to global early warning bulletins such as the GEOGLAM Early Warning Crop
Monitor, which synthesizes every month crop conditions analysis from
various institutions.},

abstract = {Objective Identifying disease-mutation relationships is a significant challenge in the advancement of precision medicine. The aim of this work is to design a tool that automates the extraction of disease-related mutations from biomedical text to advance database curation for the support of precision medicine. Materials and Methods We developed a machine-learning (ML) based method to automatically identify the mutations mentioned in the biomedical literature related to a particular disease. In order to predict a relationship between the mutation and the target disease, several features, such as statistical features, distance features, and sentiment features, were constructed. Our ML model was trained with a pre-labeled dataset consisting of manually curated information about mutation-disease associations. The model was subsequently used to extract disease-related mutations from larger biomedical literature corpora. Results The performance of the proposed approach was assessed using a benchmarking dataset. Results show that our proposed approach gains significant improvement over the previous state of the art and obtains F-measures of 0.880 and 0.845 for prostate and breast cancer mutations, respectively. Discussion To demonstrate its utility, we applied our approach to all abstracts in PubMed for 3 diseases (including a non-cancer disease). The mutations extracted were then manually validated against human-curated databases. The validation results show that the proposed approach is useful in a real-world setting to extract uncurated disease mutations from the biomedical literature. Conclusions The proposed approach improves the state of the art for mutation-disease extraction from text. It is scalable and generalizable to identify mutations for any disease at a PubMed scale.},

Cohort fertility rose from the 1930 cohort to the 1950 cohort, and then tended to decline. The increase in cohort fertility seemed most often due to a decline in infertility, and to a lesser extent to decreasing age at first marriage associated with monotheist religions. Period fertility followed a similar pattern of rise and fall from 1950 to 2000. The Total Fertility Rate at age 40 increased from 5.3 children per woman in 1950 to 6.2 in 1975, then declined to 4.9 in year 2000. A regression model indicated that some 37{\%} of the decline was attributable to contraceptive use, 24{\%} to age at marriage, and 16{\%} to urbanization.

abstract = {Recent research on the multi-factorial nature of food security has provided a wealth of analytical insight, but measurement problems remain a major challenge, not only for research, but particularly for targeting, program management, monitoring and evaluation. Building on an approach suggested in a 1996 article, this paper constructs a series of alternative food-security indicators based on the frequency and severity of consumption-related coping strategies. These alternative indicators are then compared with more standard measures, including a consumption benchmark, a poverty benchmark and a nutritional benchmark using data from the 1997 Accra Urban Food and Nutrition Study. Against these more traditional indicators, the coping strategy indicators are best at ruling out cases-that is, minimizing the risk of classifying a food-insecure household as food-secure. They also help to identify sources of vulnerability and the trade-offs made with other basic needs to acquire sufficient food. The measures outlined here are much less time-consuming and less expensive in terms of data collection and analysis, and therefore perhaps offer a pragmatic alternative to food and livelihood program managers. However, the comparative analysis of conventional benchmarks with the coping strategies indicator reveals some shortcomings with the benchmark indicators as well-a sign that perhaps the indicators of food security proposed here are both alternative and complementary measures.},

Many indicators appeared to be changing significantly in the direction of improvements, such as household density, education level of ever-married women, fertility rates, number of ante-natal care visits, premarital exams, and child immunization. Some indicators showed no significant change between the most recent surveys?for example, the interval between births, use of modern contraception, unmet need for limiting births, anemia in children, child mortality, and stunting. Some indicators are moving significantly in a contrary direction, particularly between the most recent surveys?for example, delivery by C-section, anemia in women, obesity, smoking by women, underweight and wasting in children. },

Growth stunting is a population-based indicator and can indicate the prevalence of malnutrition or nutrition-related disorders among an identified population of children. Among certain segments of the U.S. child population, most notably poor children, growth stunting occurs more often than expected, suggesting that inadequate nutrition may be a problem for these children. Available general population data are not recent enough to allow for an assessment of the impact of several major public programs designed to address the risk of inadequate nutrition among children. Analysis of data from these programs does show, however, a higher-than-expected-albeit-declining level of stunting among program participants. The serious consequences of growth stunting and malnutrition-particularly impaired cognitive development-suggest that careful consideration of the growth stunting indicator should remain an important part of policy discussions on public nutrition programs.},

abstract = {Simple indicators reflecting diet quality for young children are needed both for programs and in some research contexts. Measures of dietary diversity are relatively simple and were shown to be associated with nutrient adequacy and nutritional status. However, dietary diversity also tends to increase with income and wealth; thus, the association between dietary diversity and child nutrition may be confounded by socioeconomic factors. We used data from 11 recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to examine the association between dietary diversity and height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) for children 6-23 mo old, while controlling for household wealth/welfare and several other potentially confounding factors. Bivariate associations between dietary diversity and HAZ were observed in 9 of the 11 countries. Dietary diversity remained significant as a main effect in 7 countries in multivariate models, and interacted significantly with other factors (e.g., child age, breast-feeding status, urban/rural location) in 3 of the 4 remaining countries. Thus, dietary diversity was significantly associated with HAZ, either as a main effect or in an interaction, in all but one of the countries analyzed. These findings suggest that there is an association between child dietary diversity and nutritional status that is independent of socioeconomic factors, and that dietary diversity may indeed reflect diet quality. Before dietary diversity can be recommended for widespread use as an indicator of diet quality, additional research is required to confirm and clarify relations between various dietary diversity indicators and nutrient intake, adequacy, and density, for children with differing dietary patterns.},

abstract = {Healthy forests provide human communities with a host of important ecosystem services, including the provision of food, clean water, fuel, and natural medicines. Yet globally, about 13 million hectares of forests are lost every year, with the biggest losses in Africa and South America. As biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation due to deforestation continue at unprecedented rates, with concomitant loss of ecosystem services, impacts on human health remain poorly understood. Here, we use data from the 2010 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey, linked with satellite remote sensing data on forest cover, to explore and better understand this relationship. Our analysis finds that forest cover is associated with improved health and nutrition outcomes among children in Malawi. Children living in areas with net forest cover loss between 2000 and 2010 were 19{\%} less likely to have a diverse diet and 29{\%} less likely to consume vitamin A-rich foods than children living in areas with no net change in forest cover. Conversely, children living in communities with higher percentages of forest cover were more likely to consume vitamin A-rich foods and less likely to experience diarrhea. Net gain in forest cover over the 10-year period was associated with a 34{\%} decrease in the odds of children experiencing diarrhea (P5.002). Given that our analysis relied on observational data and that there were potential unknown factors for which we could not account, these preliminary findings demonstrate only associations, not causal relationships, between forest cover and child health and nutrition outcomes. However, the findings raise concerns about the potential short- and long-term impacts of ongoing deforestation and ecosystem degradation on community health in Malawi, and they suggest that preventing forest loss and maintaining the ecosystem services of forests are important factors in improving human health and nutrition outcomes.},

abstract = {We prospectively followed up a population-based cohort of 767 rural Malawian children from birth to 36 months to characterise the timing and predictors of malnutrition. Underweight and wasting incidence peaked between 6 and 18 months of age, whereas stunting incidence was highest during the first 6 months of age. After infancy about 40{\%} of the children were underweight, 70{\%} stunted, and about 4{\%} wasted. Small size during the first 3 months of life predicted the incidence of severe underweight (relative risk [95{\%} confidence interval], 1.8 [0.9, 3.4]), severe stunting ( 2.1 [1.3, 3.4]), and moderate wasting (2.0 [1.1, 3.5]). Children with many illness episodes in infancy had a twofold risk for the development of severe underweight and moderate wasting. Severe underweight was further predicted by residence far away from a health facility and moderate wasting by maternal HIV infection. Our conclusion is that the intrauterine period and first 6 months of life are critical for the development of stunting whereas the subsequent year is more critical for the development of underweight and wasting. Strategies combating intrauterine growth retardation, maternal HIV and infant morbidity are likely to reduce the burden of malnutrition in this population.},

IMR and U5MR have declined globally, but the degree of progress varies from country to country. Rwanda is a country where there is evidence of substantial decline in childhood mortality. This study analyzes the effects of several socio-demographic characteristics of children, mothers and households, as well as health and health care indicators on childhood mortality in Rwanda using data from the Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys implemented in 1992, 2000, 2005, and 2007-08. The data are analyzed using synthetic cohort life tables and survival analysis methods.  The analysis shows that multiplicity of birth, birth interval, antenatal care by a health professional, delivery by a health care professional, full immunization of children, mother's education, and urban/rural residence account for 52 percent of the overall decline in infant mortality between 2005 and 2007-08. During the same period, multiplicity of birth, birth interval, antenatal care by a health professional, delivery by a health care professional, full immunization of children, mother's education, mother's use of contraception, and household possession of a mosquito net account for 97 percent of the overall decline in under-five mortality. It is evident from this analysis that full immunization, contraceptive use, mosquito net distribution and professional health assistance at delivery should continue to be increased.},

Using fixed-effects regression, I calculate the change in weight-for-height in 153 children as a function of changes in latrine usage in the surrounding community. The use of longitudinal data allows children to act as their own controls, a stumbling point of many other sanitation evaluation studies using cross-sectional or case-control methods. Results provide strong evidence that children's toileting matters more than adult toileting behavior in creating a safe, hygienic environment and reducing diarrheal disease. I conclude that investments in sanitation improvements offer important externalities, and that sanitation programs must encourage the safe disposal of children's feces in order to produce maximum health gains.},

We take advantage of the randomized roll-out of Ecuador's cash transfer program to mothers to investigate how an exogenous increase in a woman's income affects domestic violence. We find that the effect of a cash transfer depends on a woman's education and on her education relative to her partner's. Our results show that for women with greater than primary school education a cash transfer significantly decreases psychological violence from her partner. For women with primary school education or less, however, the effect of a cash transfer depends on her education relative to her partner's. Specifically, the cash transfer significantly increases emotional violence in households where the woman's education is equal to or more than her partner's. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The majority of the social sciences have been slow to incorporate remote sensing and GIS as basic elements of research and reluctant to respond to global-change science. The reasons are many and complex, and cannot be addressed within the scope of this chapter (see B.L. Turner,1991, 1997a). It is sufficient to note here that the core questions of the social sciences are seen as difficult (even impossible) to address through these imaging techniques,2 and the understanding that might be gained in those areas from spatially explicit approaches has not been fully demonstrated or appreciated.},

abstract = {Renewed emphasis on programs and policies aimed at enhancing food security has intensified the search for accurate, rapid, and consistent indicators. Measures of food security are urgently required for purposes of early warning, assessment of current and prospective status of at-risk populations, and monitoring and evaluation of specific programs and policies. Different measures are often used interchangeably, without a good idea of which dimensions of food security are captured by which measures, resulting in potentially significant misclassification of food insecure populations. The objective of this paper is to compare how the most frequently used indicators of food security portray static and dynamic food security among the same sample of rural households in two districts of Tigray State, Northern Ethiopia. Seven food security indicators were assessed: the Coping Strategies Index (CSI); the Reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI); the Household Food Insecurity and Access Scale (HFIAS); the Household Hunger Scale (HHS); Food Consumption Score (FCS); the Household Dietary Diversity Scale (HDDS); and a self-assessed measure of food security (SAFS). These indicators provide very different estimates of the prevalence of food insecurity, but are moderately well correlated and depict generally similar food security trends over time. We suggest that the differences in prevalence estimates, and in some cases the weaker than expected correlation, can be explained in three ways. First, the indicators differ in the underlying aspect of food security they attempt to capture. Second, each indicator is likely only sensitive within a certain severity range of food insecurity and these ranges do not always overlap. Third, categorization of the prevalence of food insecurity is strongly dependent on the choice of cut-off points. For valid reasons, "food insecurity" has no accepted gold standard metric against which individual indicators can be gauged, though without one it is difficult to say which indicator performs "best" in correctly and reliably identifying food insecure households. The implication is that using more than one indicator is advisable, and policy makers should be aware of what elements of food insecurity each indicator portrays. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We used Natural Language Processing to extract names of species and places from text messages in a citizen science project. Bootstrap and Maximum Entropy methods were used to assess the uncertainty in the model predictions based on crowd-sourced data from the EnjoyMoths project in Taiwan. We compared uncertainty in the predictions obtained from the project and from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) field data for seven focal species of moth. The proximity to locations of easy access and the Ripley K method were used to test the level of spatial bias and randomness of the crowd-sourced data against GBIF data. Our results show that extracting information to identify the names of species and their locations from crowd-sourced data performed well. The results of the spatial bias and randomness tests revealed that the crowd-sourced data and GBIF data did not differ significantly in respect to both spatial bias and clustering. The prediction models developed using the crowd-sourced dataset were the most effective, followed by those that were developed using the combined dataset. Those that performed least well were based on the small sample size GBIF dataset. Our method demonstrates the potential for using data collected by citizen scientists and the extraction of information from vast social networks. Our analysis also shows the value of citizen science data to improve biodiversity information in combination with data collected by professionals.},

abstract = {This report evaluates the quality of birth history data from 182 DHS surveys conducted in 69 countries since the 1990s (DHS Phase II onward). It focuses on levels and trends in estimated fertility. Fertility trends are reconstructed using birth history data from DHS surveys; the regularity of trends in fertility and their consistency across surveys draw a broad picture of the quality of data from the 69 countries. The results of the reconstruction indicate that fertility data are very good in some countries (e.g., Armenia, Colombia, Indonesia, Morocco), acceptable in many countries (e.g., Jordan, Kenya, Zimbabwe), and poor in other countries (e.g., Benin, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan). The study identified discrepancies between the fertility estimates, published in the survey reports (for the three years preceding the survey) and the reconstructed fertility estimates, and explored various data quality issues that may explain these discrepancies. Displacement of recent births in the birth history table of the DHS questionnaire because of the child health section is widespread, but it is only marginally related to discrepancies between published and reconstructed fertility trends. Three other factors may account for the differences: 1) omission of recent births, 2) the Potter effect, and 3) differences in sample composition. Overall, the analyses presented in this study indicate that DHS fertility estimates are of good or acceptable quality in the majority of surveys, but that taking published fertility figures at face value could be risky in some contexts. Inferring fertility trends by comparing recently published fertility data from successive surveys may lead to erroneous trend results. },

Economic losses from floods have greatly increased, principally driven by the expanding exposure of assets at risk. It has not been possible to attribute rain-generated peak streamflow trends to anthropogenic climate change over the past several decades. Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall, based on climate models, should contribute to increases in precipitation-generated local flooding (e.g. flash flooding and urban flooding). This article assesses the literature included in the IPCC SREX report and new literature published since, and includes an assessment of changes in flood risk in seven of the regions considered in the recent IPCC SREX report—Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Europe, North America, Oceania and Polar regions. Also considering newer publications, this article is consistent with the recent IPCC SREX assessment finding that the impacts of climate change on flood characteristics are highly sensitive to the detailed nature of2 Zbigniew W.

abstract = {Up to present, research relating environmental change to human mobility has found out that environmental factors can play a role in migration without being conclusive. Further, in the context of climate change, scholarly literature on migration ranges across a host of climatic stressors and geographies, making it difficult to date to solve the debate whether migration is a form of adaptation or an indicator of limits to adaptation. To address both of these debates, original research was undertaken to answer the question ?under what circumstances do households (HHs) use migration as a risk management strategy when facing rainfall variability and food insecurity??. This research administered a HH survey (n?=?1300) and participatory research (n?=?2000 respondents) in districts in eight countries (Guatemala, Peru, Ghana, Tanzania, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Vietnam). The findings reveal that the answer to how climatic stressors affect migration decisions and the degree to which migration improves the adaptive capacity of those HHs lie in the vulnerability of the HH and its sensitivity to climatic factors. The data reveal for the first time in a comparable global study distinct HH profiles of ?resilience? and ?vulnerability?. At the same time, the article distinguishes between ?content? migration ? rather associated with resilient HHs ? and ?erosive? migration ? rather associated with vulnerable HHs. However, the article also highlights that there are not always clear cuts but very often grey areas and overlaps among the HHs of the study when applying these typologies. Moreover, the article relates these profiles to an agent-based modelling approach applied in the Tanzania case to explore under what scenarios rainfall variability and food security have the potential to become significant drivers of human mobility in particular regions of the world in the next two to three decades.},

abstract = {A key challenge of ecosystem management is determining how to manage multiple ecosystem services across landscapes. Enhancing important provisioning ecosystem services, such as food and timber, often leads to tradeoffs between regulating and cultural ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, flood protection, and tourism. We developed a framework for analyzing the provision of multiple ecosystem services across landscapes and present an empirical demonstration of ecosystem service bundles, sets of services that appear together repeatedly. Ecosystem service bundles were identified by analyzing the spatial patterns of 12 ecosystem services in a mixed-use landscape consisting of 137 municipalities in Quebec, Canada. We identified six types of ecosystem service bundles and were able to link these bundles to areas on the landscape characterized by distinct social-ecological dynamics. Our results show landscape-scale tradeoffs between provisioning and almost all regulating and cultural ecosystem services, and they show that a greater diversity of ecosystem services is positively correlated with the provision of regulating ecosystem services. Ecosystem service-bundle analysis can identify areas on a landscape where ecosystem management has produced exceptionally desirable or undesirable sets of ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere {\textless}350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80{\%} of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone ({\textless}5{\%} reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use ({\textless}4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change ({\textless}15{\%} of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of {\textless}10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social–ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of “planetary boundaries” lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the “planetary playing field” for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale.},

By mid-century, the mean estimates of aggregate production changes in SSA under our preferred model specification are − 22, − 17, − 17, − 18, and − 8{\%} for maize, sorghum, millet, groundnut, and cassava, respectively. In all cases except cassava, there is a 95{\%} probability that damages exceed 7{\%}, and a 5{\%} probability that they exceed 27{\%}.

abstract = {Impact of Future Climate and Land Use Change on Non-timber Forest Product Provision in Benin, West Africa: Linking Niche-based Modeling with Ecosystem Service Values. Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) make a major contribution to the livelihoods of the West African population. However, these ecosystem services are threatened by climate and land use change. Our study aims at 1) the quantification and monetary mapping of important NTFPs, and 2) developing a novel approach to assess the impacts of climate and land use change on the economic benefits derived from these NTFPs. We performed household interviews in northern Benin to gather data on annual quantities of collected NTFPs from the three most important savanna tree species: Adansonia digitata, Parkia biglobosa, and Vitellaria paradoxa. Current market prices of the NTFPs were derived from local markets. We assessed the species' current and future (2050) occurrence probabilities by calibrating niche-based models with climate and land use data at a 0.1A degrees resolution (cell: similar to 10 x 10 km). To assess future economic gains and losses, respectively, we linked modeled species' occurrence probabilities with the spatially assigned monetary values. Highest current annual benefits are obtained from V. paradoxa (USD 54,111 A +/- 28,126/cell), followed by P. biglobosa (USD 32,246 A +/- 16,526/cell) and A. digitata (USD 9,514 A +/- 6,243/cell). The future simulations showed spatially varying impacts of environmental change. In particular A. digitata might benefit in some regions. However, large areas are projected to lose up to 50 {\%} of their current economic value by 2050 with regard to the three species. Our findings provide a first benchmark for local policy-makers to economically compare different land use options and adjust existing management strategies.},

abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa has been portrayed as the most vulnerable region to the impacts of global climate change because of its reliance on agriculture which is highly sensitive to weather and climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and light and extreme events and low capacity for adaptation. This article reviews evidence on the scope and nature of the climate change challenge; and assesses the impact of climate change on agriculture and food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. From the review, it is apparent that the climate in Africa is already exhibiting significant changes, evident by changes in average temperature, change in amount of rainfall and patterns and the prevalence of frequency and intensity of weather extremes. The review also revealed that although uncertainties exist with regards to the magnitude of impacts, climate will negatively affect agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, as result of current and expected climate change, the area suitable for agriculture, the length of growing seasons and yield potential, particularly along the margins of semi-arid and arid areas, are expected to decrease. These impacts will affect all components of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation and food stability and hence increase the risk of hunger in the region. The review thus confirms the general consensus that Sub-Saharan Africa is the most vulnerable region to climate change. It suggests that, policymakers and development agencies should focus on formulating and implementing policies and programmes that promote farm level adaptation strategies currently being practiced by farmers across the region. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Children whose parents and households have certain characteristics are known to be more vulnerable to negative child outcomes. Four components of vulnerability have been identified by UNICEF: (1) the child has lost one or both parents; (2) the child is not living with either parent; (3) the child lives in a household in which no adult has any formal education; and (4) the child?s household is in the bottom two wealth quintiles. Children with the greatest vulnerability have components (1) and/or (2) and/or (3), and component (4). This report uses 80 surveys conducted by The Demographic and Health Surveys Program (DHS) and 55 Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), between 2000 and 2014 in 70 different countries, to estimate the prevalence of the components and combinations of vulnerability. These prevalences are combined with estimated numbers of children age 0-17, from the U.N. Population Division, to estimate the numbers of vulnerable children in the years of the surveys and in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, except when those years are more than five years away from the survey dates. The countries with the highest combined prevalence are South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, Guinea, Benin, Sierra Leone, Chad, Afghanistan, and Senegal. In these countries, 27{\%} to 36{\%} of children age 0-17 are in the combination of greatest vulnerability. Afghanistan has the highest combined prevalence outside of sub-Saharan Africa. These prevalences and population estimates may be used to assess the need for assistance and the coverage of programs.  },

abstract = {Child malnutrition remains one of the health challenges that African countries have to deal with to remain on course to achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This study analyzes the impact of maternal education on child nutritional status in three African countries, based on data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the 2010 Malawi DHS, with a sample of 4,563 children age 0-59 months; the 2009-10 Tanzania DHS, 4,821 children; and the 2005-06 Zimbabwe DHS, 3,473 children. Bivariate analyses and the Pearson Chi-square test of independence were used to test the association of maternal education and three measures of child nutrition?stunting, wasting, and underweight. A survey logistic regression was employed to assess the determinants of the three measures and to examine the relationship between maternal education and child nutrition.  The results show that in all three countries the three measures of child nutritional status significantly decrease with increased levels of mother?s education. The analysis also shows that, after controlling for other factors, maternal education reduces the odds of the three measures of child nutrition in all three countries. The threshold level of maternal education above which it significantly improves child stunting and underweight is 9 years of schooling in Malawi and 11 years of schooling in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. The policy implication is that the free primary education currently offered in the three countries may not be sufficient to address child malnutrition. In all three countries, if maternal education is to play a significant role in reducing child malnutrition, women need to be educated beyond the primary school level. In addition, offering nutritional education programs for women, particularly those with low levels of education, would help them attain better nutritional outcomes for their children.},

abstract = {Understanding rural environmental dependence in a rural population is an important factor in the framing of environmental policy with the dual aim of tackling poverty and conserving nature. Firstly, this study compares the assessment of environmental dependence between poverty groupings based on income and asset measures. Using a composite asset index, we were able to distinguish the asset poor from the asset non-poor. We then combined income data with the asset index, enabling us to disentangle the stochastic and structural nature of poverty. The distribution of poor and non-poor households based on income measures was significantly different from that based on asset measures. The income poor are substantially more dependent on environmental resources than the income non-poor (about 15{\%} difference) while strikingly minimal difference was observed in environmental dependence between the asset poor and non-poor (less than 2{\%} difference). The level of environmental dependence between the poor and non-poor households differs with the choice of welfare measure and combining two of these measures to identify wealth groups provides policy makers with better insight on the variations in environmental dependence.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Maternal nutritional status (MNS) is a strong predictor of growth and development in the first 1000 days of life and may influence susceptibility to non-communicable diseases in adulthood. However, the role of nutrition during this window of developmental plasticity in Africa is unclear. This paper reviews published data to address whether maternal nutrition during the first 1000 days is important for Africa, with a focus on MNS and its associations with fetal growth and birth, neonatal and infant outcomes. A systematic approach was used to search the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, SciSearch and Cochrane Library. In all, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria for the specific objectives. MNS in Africa showed features typical of the epidemiological transition: higher prevalences of maternal overweight and obesity and lower underweight, poor diet quality 1 and high anaemia prevalence. Maternal body mass index and greater gestational weight gain (GWG) were positively associated with birth weight; however, maternal overweight and obesity were associated with increased risk of macrosomia and intrauterine growth restriction. Maternal anaemia was associated with lower birth weight. Macro- and micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy were associated with improvements in GWG, birth weight and mortality risk. Data suggest poor MNS in Africa and confirms the importance of the first 1000 days as a critical period for nutritional intervention to improve growth, birth outcomes and potential future health risk. However, there is a lack of data beyond birth and a need for longitudinal data through infancy to 2 years of age.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In Mali, amidst moves toward political decentralization and the transfer of authority to manage natural resources, woodcutting has become an important tool for the assertion of territorial claims by villagers. The decentralization process has itself led to a profound political shake-up between the central state seeking to maintain land ownership and the de facto management of land by customary village authorities. But it is, however, primarily the devolution of forest resource management to village-led organizations that has prompted the cross-scale legitimization and assertion of various territorial claims from 1995 onwards. Based on two in-depth case studies on the outskirts of Bamako, Mali, the authors illustrate how new practices revolving around woodcutting and charcoal-making have been instrumental in intra- and inter-village disputes. At the village level, this transfer tends to exacerbate tenure claims over land and trees with the reactivation of autochthony-related arguments and thus the risk of excluding the most vulnerable social groups which are typically involved in woodcutting. At the inter-village level, this gives villages the opportunity to claim and demarcate boundaries by cutting, painting signs on some trees, or more radically tree felling being carried out solely to demonstrate appropriation. At the municipal level, this transfer leads to political and social adjustments between customary and decentralized authorities, each struggling to build their legitimacy in natural resource management. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper reports the response of forage production to cattle grazing on prairie dominated by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) in south-central North Dakota through the growing season at 5 grazing intensities: no grazing, light grazing (1.3 ± 0.7 animal unit months [AUM]{\textperiodcentered}ha-1), moderate grazing (2.7 ± 1.0 AUM{\textperiodcentered}ha-1), heavy grazing (4.4 ± 1.2 AUM{\textperiodcentered}ha -1), and extreme grazing (6.9 ± 2.1 AUM{\textperiodcentered}ha -1; mean ± SD). Annual herbage production data were collected on silty and overflow range sites from 1989 to 2005. Precipitation and sod temperature were used as covariates in the analysis. On silty range sites, the light treatment produced the most herbage (3 410 kg{\textperiodcentered}ha-1), and production was reduced as the grazing intensity increased. Average total production for the season was 545 kg{\textperiodcentered}ha-1 less on the ungrazed treatment and 909 kg{\textperiodcentered}ha-1 less on the extreme treatment than on the light treatment. On overflow range sites, there were no significant differences between the light (4 131 kg{\textperiodcentered}ha-1), moderate (4 360 kg{\textperiodcentered}ha-1), and heavy treatments (4 362 kg{\textperiodcentered}ha -1; P {\textgreater} 0.05). Total production on overflow range sites interacted with precipitation, and production on the grazed treatments was greater than on the ungrazed treatment when precipitation (from the end of the growing season in the previous year to the end of the grazing season in the current year) was greater than 267.0, 248.4, 262.4, or 531.5 mm on the light, moderate, heavy, and extreme treatments, respectively. However, production on the extreme treatment was less than on the ungrazed treatment if precipitation was less than 315.2 mm. We conclude that low to moderate levels of grazing can increase production over no grazing, but that the level of grazing that maximizes production depends upon the growing conditions of the current year.},

abstract = {Cash crops are developing in the once forested areas of Indonesia in parallel with market and economic improvements. Perennial crops such as coffee, cocoa, and rubber were first planted in estates by private or public companies. Local people then integrated these crops into their farming systems, often through the planting of agroforests, that is, intercropping the new cash crop with upland rice and food crops. The crop was generally mixed with fruit trees, timber, and other useful plants. A geographic specialization occurred, driven by biophysical constraints and market opportunities, with expansion of cocoa in Sulawesi, coffee in Lampung, and natural rubber in eastern Sumatra. However, during the past three decades, these agroforests have increasingly been converted into more productive monoculture plantations. A common trajectory can be observed in agricultural landscapes dominated by a perennial cash crop: from ladang to agroforests, and then to monoculture plantations. This process combines agricultural expansion at the expense of natural forests and specialization of the land cover at the expense of biodiversity and wildlife habitats. We determined the main drivers of agricultural expansion and intensification in three regions of Indonesia based on perception surveys and land use profitability analysis. When the national and international contexts clearly influence farmers{\&}rsquo; decisions, local people appear very responsive to economic opportunities. They do not hesitate to change their livelihood system if it can increase their income. Their cultural or sentimental attachment to the forest is not sufficient to prevent forest conversion},

abstract = {This paper outlines the development of an integrated interdisciplinary approach to agri-food research, designed to address the ‘grand challenge' of global food security. Rather than meeting this challenge by working in separate domains or via single-disciplinary perspectives, we chart the development of a system-wide approach to the food supply chain. In this approach, social and environmental questions are simultaneously addressed. Firstly, we provide a holistic model of the agri-food system, which depicts the processes involved, the principal inputs and outputs, the actors and the external influences, emphasising the system's interactions, feedbacks and complexities. Secondly, we show how this model necessitates a research programme that includes the study of land-use, crop production and protection, food processing, storage and distribution, retailing and consumption, nutrition and public health. Acknowledging the methodological and epistemological challenges involved in developing this approach, we propose two specific ways forward. Firstly, we propose a method for analysing and modelling agri-food systems in their totality, which enables the complexity to be reduced to essential components of the whole system to allow tractable quantitative analysis using LCA and related methods. This initial analysis allows for more detailed quantification of total system resource efficiency, environmental impact and waste. Secondly, we propose a method to analyse the ethical, legal and political tensions that characterise such systems via the use of deliberative fora. We conclude by proposing an agenda for agri-food research which combines these two approaches into a rational programme for identifying, testing and implementing the new agri-technologies and agri-food policies, advocating the critical application of nexus thinking to meet the global food security challenge.},

abstract = {One of the oldest contraceptive methods used to control fertility is coitus interruptus or withdrawal, as it is more commonly known. The method?s history probably goes back to the discovery that ejaculation into the vagina caused pregnancy. The method has been widely practiced throughout the world history, playing an important role in controlling fertility prior to the inception of modern contraceptives. In Turkey, couples more often adopt traditional than modern contraceptives, and 99 percent of traditional methods users have sued withdrawal. Among currently married women, 24 percent report current use of withdrawal. In comparison, 20 percent are relying on the IUD, the second most widely used method in Turkey. Turkey?s rate of withdrawal use is among the highest in the world. Only the rates in select countries in Eastern Europe such as Bulgaria at 38 percent and Romania at 35 percent surpass it. In the developing world, rates are generally substantially lower rates, with Mauritius at 16 percent and Vietnam at 11 percent having among the highest levels of withdrawal use. Turkey?s high prevalence of withdrawal use is noteworthy for a number of reasons. First, approximately two-thirds of currently married women in Turkey do not want to have any more children and an additional 14{\%} would like to postpone their next birth. The high failure rates associated with withdrawal means that women who seek to control childbearing by using the method will frequently experience unplanned pregnancies that often end in an induced abortion.},

abstract = {Almost every ecosystem has been amended so that plants and animals can be used as food, fibre, fodder, medicines, traps and weapons. Historically, wild plants and animals were sole dietary components for hunter-gatherer and forager cultures. Today, they remain key to many agricultural communities. The mean use of wild foods by agricultural and forager communities in 22 countries of Asia and Africa (36 studies) is 90-100 species per location. Aggregate country estimates can reach 300-800 species (e.g. India, Ethiopia, Kenya). The mean use of wild species is 120 per community for indigenous communities in both industrialized and developing countries. Many of these wild foods are actively managed, suggesting there is a false dichotomy around ideas of the agricultural and the wild: hunter-gatherers and foragers farm and manage their environments, and cultivators use many wild plants and animals. Yet, provision of and access to these sources of food may be declining as natural habitats come under increasing pressure from development, conservation-exclusions and agricultural expansion. Despite their value, wild foods are excluded from official statistics on economic values of natural resources. It is clear that wild plants and animals continue to form a significant proportion of the global food basket, and while a variety of social and ecological drivers are acting to reduce wild food use, their importance may be set to grow as pressures on agricultural productivity increase.},

Incidence is high, and the disease has made inroads into all segments of the population, among groups not usually considered to be at high risk. Care of those infected with HIV/AIDS and with related disease such as tuberculosis is placing  a heavy burden on already limited resources within the health sector. The first cases of HIV/AIDS were reported in Zimbabwe in 1987. Although initial response to the disease was slow, public officials and medical personnel soon realized the potential severity of the problem and launched public information campaigns. Generally, the messages promoted in the first campaign cautioned people to avoid prostitutes, use condoms, and stay with a stay with a single sexual partner. They did not acknowledge the frequency of sexual exchanges that often take place among men and women, not as prostitution, but as a mutually beneficial relationship sometimes of long standing (Vos, 1994). They also did not attempt to overcome the negative image of condoms, their association with illicit, possibly contaminating intercourse, or that women are culturally constrained from demanding condom use. Inadequate attention was given to the implications of one partner accepting monogamy and faithfulness and hence believing they were protected from infection, while the other maintained a pattern of multiple and frequent partners. Another flaw was the failure to acknowledge the possibly of past exposure to infection before deciding that a partner in serial monogamy was free from infection.},

Floods occur often in the region triggered by heavy monsoon precipitation and can cause enormous damages to lives, property, crops and infrastructure. The frequency of extreme floods is on the rise in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Past extreme floods fall within the range of climate variability but frequency, magnitude and extent flooding may increase in South Asia in future due to climate change. Flood risk is sensitive to different levels of warming. For example, in Bangladesh, analysis shows that most of the expected changes in flood depth and extent would occur between 0 and 2C warming. The three major rivers Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna/Barak will play similar roles in future flooding regimes as they are doing presently. Increases in future flooding can cause extensive damage to rice crops in the monsoon. This may have implications for food security especially of poor women and children. Floods can also impact public health in the flood plains and in the coastal areas.},

Results show that care seeking from public sources is predominant in African MCH priority countries while care seeking from private sources is predominant in Asian MCH priority countries. The majority of countries did not show significant improvements between the two most recent DHS surveys in the level of care seeking for fever or symptoms of ARI, although care seeking for diarrhea showed more widespread improvement. The use of appropriate antimalarial treatment varied widely across MCH priority countries. Despite the widespread increase in care seeking for diarrhea, there has not been a parallel increase in coverage of appropriate treatment for diarrhea. In conclusion, our results show that the percentage of children with diarrhea, fever, and symptoms of ARI who reach the health system remains low in many high childhood mortality settings.

abstract = {Existing evidence on the impacts of parental education on child nutrition is plagued by both internal and external validity concerns. In this paper we try to address these concerns through a novel econometric analysis of 376,992 preschool children from 56 developing countries. We compare a na{\"{i}}ve least square model to specifications that include cluster fixed effects and cohort-based educational rankings to reduce biases from omitted variables before gauging sensitivity to sub-samples and exploring potential explanations of education-nutrition linkages. We find that the estimated nutritional returns to parental education are: (a) substantially reduced in models that include fixed effects and cohort rankings; (b) larger for mothers than for fathers; (c) generally increasing, and minimal for primary education; (d) increasing with household wealth; (e) larger in countries/regions with higher burdens of undernutrition; (f) larger in countries/regions with higher schooling quality; and (g) highly variable across country sub-samples. These results imply substantial uncertainty and variability in the returns to education, but results from the more stringent models imply that even the achievement of very ambitious education targets would only lead to modest reductions in stunting rates in high-burden countries. We speculate that education might have more impact on the nutritional status of the next generation if school curricula focused on directly improving health and nutritional knowledge of future parents.},

abstract = {[BACKGROUND] Globally, about 30{\%} of women have experienced physical or sexual violence, or both, from an intimate partner during their lifetime. Associations between poverty and women's increased risk of intimate partner violence have been observed. We therefore aimed to assess the effect of a violence prevention intervention delivered to women participating in a group-based microfinance scheme in Tanzania. [METHODS] We did a cluster randomised controlled trial among women taking part in a microfinance loan scheme in Mwanza city, Tanzania. A microfinance loan group was only enrolled if at least 70{\%} of members consented. We randomly assigned the microfinance groups in blocks of six to receive either the intervention (ie, the intervention arm) or be wait-listed for the intervention after the trial (ie, the control arm). Women in both arms of the trial met weekly for loan repayments. Only those in the intervention arm participated in the ten-session MAISHA intervention that aims to empower women and prevent intimate partner violence. Given the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to mask participants or the research team. The primary outcome was a composite of reported past-year physical or sexual intimate partner violence, or both. Secondary outcome measures were past-year physical, sexual, and emotional intimate partner violence; acceptability and tolerance of intimate partner violence; and attitudes and beliefs related to intimate partner violence. These outcomes were assessed 24 months after the intervention. An intention-to-treat analysis was done, adjusting for age, education, and baseline measure of the respective outcome. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02592252. [FINDINGS] Between September, 2014, and June, 2015, 66 (65{\%}) of 101 microfinance groups approached in the study area met the trial eligibility criteria and were enrolled, of which 33 (n=544 women) were allocated to the intervention arm and 33 (n=505 women) to the control arm. Overall, 485 (89{\%}) of 544 women in the intervention arm and 434 (86{\%}) of 505 in the control arm completed the outcomes assessment. Among the intervention arm, 112 (23{\%}) of 485 women reported past-year physical or sexual intimate partner violence, or both, compared with 119 (27{\%}) of 434 in the control arm (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0{\textperiodcentered}69, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}47–1{\textperiodcentered}01; p=0{\textperiodcentered}056). Women in the intervention arm were less likely to report physical intimate partner violence (aOR 0{\textperiodcentered}64, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}41–0{\textperiodcentered}99; p=0{\textperiodcentered}043) and were less likely to express attitudes accepting of intimate partner violence (0{\textperiodcentered}45, 0{\textperiodcentered}34–0{\textperiodcentered}61; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) or beliefs that intimate partner violence is a private matter (0{\textperiodcentered}51, 0{\textperiodcentered}32–0{\textperiodcentered}81; p=0{\textperiodcentered}005) or should be tolerated (0{\textperiodcentered}68, 0{\textperiodcentered}45–1{\textperiodcentered}01; p=0{\textperiodcentered}055). There was no evidence of an effect on reported sexual or emotional intimate partner violence. There were no reports that participation in the trial had led to new episodes of violence or worsening of ongoing violence and abuse. [INTERPRETATION] Reported physical or sexual intimate partner violence, or both, was reduced among women who participated in the intervention arm, although the effect was greater for physical intimate partner violence, suggesting that intimate partner violence is preventable in high-risk settings such as Tanzania.

In general, our findings suggest the promotion of informal social capital and natural resources as they are cheaper and more accessible coping strategies, in comparison to, for example, insurance, which remains unaffordable in most rural parts of sub-Saharan Africa.

abstract = {The results of the 2010/11 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) showed that 32 percent of births among women age 15-49 in the five years preceding the survey were unintended?either mistimed (wanted later) or not wanted at all (unwanted). Unintended births pose a serious threat to the  attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly for reducing child mortality and improving maternal health. The aim of this study is to establish if there is a relationship between women?s HIV status and having unintended births.  The study used cross-sectional data from the 2010/11 ZDHS. Of the 9,171 women respondents in the survey, this study focused on the 1,458 women age 15-49 who had had a birth in the two years preceding the survey, were tested for HIV, and responded to the household relations module (domestic violence module). Almost 14 percent of women in this study were HIV-positive and about one-third (34 percent) reported that a birth in the two years preceding the survey was unintended.  The analysis showed that, controlling for other factors, 1) HIV-positive women were almost twice as likely as HIV-negative women to have had an unintended birth; 2) women who experienced spousal physical violence during their lifetime and women who experienced non-spousal sexual violence were strongly associated with unintended births; and 3) unintended births were significantly associated with the following variables: use of family planning, contraceptive discontinuation, mother?s age at birth, marital status, and preceding birth interval of the index child.  Unintended births are a major challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. This analysis showed that HIV status is related to unintended births, with HIV-positive women being twice as likely to have an unintended birth. As a result, countries with a high HIV prevalence may be more at risk for a high burden of unintended pregnancies. HIV-positive women need comprehensive information on family planning.},

abstract = {In most developing countries, people are heavily reliant on inexpensive, locally grown food. However, while dependence on cropping crosses national and continental boundaries, the selection of land for cropping has adapted to the available conditions. Recent analyses conducted by the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) show that the characteristics of cropped area differ in different countries, indicating that the critical variables influencing the selection of location for the establishment of agriculture also vary. This study looks at a selection of FEWS NET work using high resolution remotely sensed imagery to analyze cropped areas in Afghanistan, Eritrea, Guatemala, Haiti, Mali, Mozambique, South Sudan, Burkina-Faso and Tajikistan. This analysis identifies similarities and differences in the significant factors impacting cropped area in each country. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the application of high-resolution imagery to estimating cultivation is assessed. The results highlight the context-specific nature of cultivation and the effectiveness of very high-resolution satellite imagery for crop estimation. The results also suggest that a single, generally applicable model of cultivation will require complex interactions between economic, governmental and population characteristics in addition to local landscape/geophysical properties. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.},

abstract = {This study examined levels of health insurance coverage in 30 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), using nationally representative data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). In eight countries with health insurance coverage exceeding 10 percent, we used propensity score matching and estimated the impact of health insurance status on the use of antenatal care and facility-based delivery care. Health insurance coverage rates were less than 5 percent in most countries. In a few countries (Rwanda, Gabon, Ghana, and Indonesia), more than one-third of interviewed women and men reported coverage of health insurance, with the highest rate found in Rwanda. Educational attainment was associated with a higher likelihood of enrolling in health insurance. Pro-wealthy disparities in health insurance coverage existed in the majority of countries. In Cambodia and Gabon, however, poor women were more likely than the rich to be covered by health insurance, suggesting that in these countries policies focusing on providing insurance for the poor have been effective.  Our analysis found significant positive effects of health insurance coverage on at least one measure of maternal health care use in seven of the eight countries evaluated. Indonesia stands out for the most systematic effect of health insurance across all measures, followed by Cambodia, Rwanda, and Ghana. The positive impact of health insurance appeared more consistent on the use of facility-based delivery than use of antenatal care. The analysis provides clear evidence that health insurance has contributed to the increased use of maternal health care services. },

However, evidence for this relationship has not been systematically reviewed. This review of empirical studies aims to: (1) synthesise the evidence linking women's empowerment and child nutritional status in South Asia and (2) suggest directions for future research. We systematically searched Global Health, Embase (classic and Ovid), MEDLINE, Campbell Collaboration, Popline, Eldis, Web of Science, EconLit and Scopus. We generated 1661 studies for abstract and title screening. We full-text screened 44 of these, plus 10 additional studies the authors were aware of. Only 12 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We included English materials published between 1990 and 2012 that examined the relationship(s) of at least one women's empowerment domain and nutritional status among South Asian children. Data were extracted and synthesised within three domains of empowerment: control of resources and autonomy, workload and time, and social support. The results showed women's empowerment to be generally associated with child anthropometry, but the findings are mixed. Inter-study differences in population characteristics, settings or methods/conceptualisations of women's empowerment, and the specific domains studied, likely contributed to these inconsistencies. This review also highlights that different women's empowerment domains may relate differently to child nutritional status. Future research should aim to harmonise definitions of women's empowerment, which key domains it should include, and how it is measured. Rigorous evaluation work is also needed to establish which policies and programmes facilitate women's empowerment and in turn, foster child nutritional well-being.},

When food is replenished, spontaneous catch-up (CU) growth usually occurs, bringing the child back to its original growth trajectory. However, in some cases, the CU growth is not complete, leading to a permanent growth deficit. This review summarizes our current knowledge regarding the mechanism regulating nutrition and growth, including systemic factors, such as insulin, growth hormone, insulin- like growth factor-1, vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor-21, etc., and local mechanisms, including autophagy, as well as regulators of transcription, protein synthesis, miRNAs and epigenetics. Studying the molecular mechanisms regulating CU growth may lead to the establishment of better nutritional and therapeutic regimens for more effective CU growth in children with malnutrition and growth abnormalities. It will be fascinating to follow this research in the coming years and to translate the knowledge gained to clinical benefit.},

abstract = {Cause-related marketing (C-RM) has risen to become a popular strategy to increase business value through profit-motivated giving. Despite the growing number of articles published in the last decade, no comprehensive analysis of the most discussed constructs of cause-related marketing is available. This paper uses an advanced Text Mining methodology (a Bayesian contextual analysis algorithm known as Correlated Topic Model, CTM) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of 246 articles published in 40 different journals between 1988 and 2013 on the subject of cause-related marketing. Text Mining also allows quantitative analyses to be performed on the literature. For instance, it is shown that the most prominent long-term topics discussed since 1988 on the subject are “brand-cause fit”, “law and Ethics”, and “corporate and social identification”, while the most actively discussed topic presently is “sectors raising social taboos and moral debates”. The paper has two goals: first, it introduces the technique of CTM to the Marketing area, illustrating how Text Mining may guide, simplify, and enhance review processes while providing objective building blocks (topics) to be used in a review; second, it applies CTM to the C-RM field, uncovering and summarizing the most discussed topics. Mining text, however, is not aimed at replacing all subjective decisions that must be taken as part of literature review methodologies.},

abstract = {Improving maternal health remains a priority in Kenya. It is essential in all countries that women have access to high-quality medical care before pregnancy, during pregnancy and childbirth, and afterwards. Timely care could avert many maternal deaths. Despite interventions to promote maternal care, few women use skilled delivery care in Kenya, and maternal mortality rates remain high. While nearly all women have at least one ANC visit, fewer than 50{\%} have the four or more visits recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thus they miss out on key services and tests and do not receive medical advice on possible pregnancy complications. Lack of sufficient antenatal care interrupts the continuum of maternal care.  This study examines the role of antenatal care in predicting use of health facilities for delivery among women in Kenya. Data from the 2008-09 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) were analyzed using Stata 11.0 software. Logistic regression was used to run univariable and multivariable analyses. The final multivariable models adjust for maternal age at last birth, education, urban-rural residence, province, level of exposure to mass media, religion, wealth index, and birth order. The study found that both the number of ANC visits and the quality of these visits (based on number of services received) are positive predictors of health facility delivery. Women who received a higher quality of antenatal care (based on an index derived from the number of ANC services received) were from two to four times more likely to deliver in a health facility compared with women who received only one service. Similarly, women with four or more ANC visits were two and a half times more likely than women with no ANC visits to deliver in a health facility. Interventions should target both the supply and demand sides by ensuring that pregnant women know about ANC services to ask for and that health facilities are sufficiently equipped to provide these services.},

abstract = {Background: This paper investigates the influence of socioeconomic status on specific HIV/AIDS knowledge and the relationship between poverty and risky sexual behaviour in Tanzania. Poverty is one of the key factors that influence exposure of both men and women to the risk of contracting HIV.  Poorer men and women are more likely than wealthier men and women to be exposed to HIV infection because they engage in higher-risk sexual behaviour. Methods: Analysis involved the use of data from the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Data analysis involved univariate analysis for dependant and independent variables, bivariate analysis, and thereafter multivariate logistic analysis for generating the odds ratio and confidence intervals (CIs) for each predictor. Results: We found that education, wealth, mobility, employment, and media exposure have a strong association with knowledge that a healthy-looking person can have HIV/AIDS. Poverty influences higher-risk sexual behavi our for both men and women?defined here as sex with a non-marital, non-cohabiting partner. Poverty and lack of education among men and women are associated with lower rates of condom use. Results also show that poorer men are more likely than richer men to report paying for sex. Conclusion: Poverty, lack of education, low mobility, and earlier sexual debut are among the major factors associated with risky sexual behaviour. More efforts on poverty reduction, more investment in education, and better facilitation of easy access to media need to be undertaken in order to reduce the vulnerability of poor people to contracting HIV/AIDS.},

However, the proportion of pregnancies resulting in live births that are reported as wanted when conceived has declined over time. There is therefore a need to explore the risk factors for experiencing unintended pregnancy in Jordan. Methods: Two multinomial logistic regression analyses of the risk factors for unintended pregnancy (both unwanted and mistimed) were conducted using a subsample of women who were interviewed for the 2002 Jordan Population and Family Health Survey. The study sample for the first analysis consisted of 3,881 women whose most recent pregnancy occurred between January 1997 and October 2002. The second analysis selected from this group the 2,030 women who had used a contraceptive method before the pregnancy and within the five years before the survey, to determine the effect of the contraceptive source and method on the probability of experiencing an unplanned pregnancy. Results: The multivariate analysis indicated that several factors significantly influence the likelihood that a woman would classify her most recent pregnancy as unwanted or mistimed. Risk factors that independently increase the likelihood of an unintended pregnancy included ever-use of modern contraception, use of the contraceptive pill, and number of previous births. Factors associated with pregnancy reported as intended include obtaining contraceptive services from private medical providers, and the ability to pay for health care with little difficulty.},

abstract = {Since 1980, the number of undernourished people in eastern and southern Africa has more than doubled. Rural development stalled and rural poverty expanded during the 1990s. Population growth remains very high, and declining per-capita agricultural capacity retards progress toward Millennium Development goals. Analyses of in situ station data and satellite observations of precipitation have identified another problematic trend: main growing-season rainfall receipts have diminished by ≈15{\%} in food-insecure countries clustered along the western rim of the Indian Ocean. Occurring during the main growing seasons in poor countries dependent on rain-fed agriculture, these declines are societally dangerous. Will they persist or intensify? Tracing moisture deficits upstream to an anthropogenically warming Indian Ocean leads us to conclude that further rainfall declines are likely. We present analyses suggesting that warming in the central Indian Ocean disrupts onshore moisture transports, reducing continental rainfall. Thus, late 20th-century anthropogenic Indian Ocean warming has probably already produced societally dangerous climate change by creating drought and social disruption in some of the world's most fragile food economies. We quantify the potential impacts of the observed precipitation and agricultural capacity trends by modeling "millions of undernourished people" as a function of rainfall, population, cultivated area, seed, and fertilizer use. Persistence of current tendencies may result in a 50{\%} increase in undernourished people by 2030. On the other hand, modest increases in per-capita agricultural productivity could more than offset the observed precipitation declines. Investing in agricultural development can help mitigate climate change while decreasing rural poverty and vulnerability. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {It is important to identify the “correct” number of topics in mechanisms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) as they determine the quality of features that are presented as features for classifiers like SVM. In this work we propose a measure to identify the correct number of topics and offer empirical evidence in its favor in terms of classification accuracy and the number of topics that are naturally present in the corpus. We show the merit of the measure by applying it on real-world as well as synthetic data sets(both text and images). In proposing this measure, we view LDA as a matrix factorization mechanism, wherein a given corpus C is split into two matrix factors M 1 and M 2 as given by C d*w = M1 d*t x Q t*w . Where d is the number of documents present in the corpus and w is the size of the vocabulary. The quality of the split depends on “t”, the right number of topics chosen. The measure is computed in terms of symmetric KL-Divergence of salient distributions that are derived from these matrix factors. We observe that the divergence values are higher for non-optimal number of topics – this is shown by a 'dip' at the right value for 't'.},

abstract = {Using the LSMS-ISA Tanzania National Panel Survey by the World Bank, we study the relationship between rural household consumption growth and temperature shocks over the period 2008–2013. Temperature shocks have a negative and significant impact on household growth if their initial consumption lies below a critical threshold. As such, temperature shocks slow income convergence among households, at least in the short run. Crop yields and total factor productivity in agriculture are the main transmission channels. Extrapolating from short-term elasticities to long-run phenomena, these findings support the Schelling Conjecture: economic development would help poor farming households to reduce the impacts of climate change. Hence, closing the yield gap, modernizing agriculture and favouring the structural transformation of the economy are all crucial issues for adaptation of farmers to the negative effects of global warming.},

abstract = {The United Nations Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 is a key initiative within global efforts to halt and eventually reverse the loss of biodiversity. The very first target of this plan states that “by 2020, at the latest, people are aware of the values of biodiversity and the steps they can take to conserve and use it sustainably.” Zoos and aquariums worldwide, attracting more than 700 million visits every year, could potentially make a positive contribution to this target. However, a global evaluation of the educational impacts of visits to zoos and aquariums is entirely lacking in the existing literature. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale impact evaluation study. We used a pre- and postvisit repeated-measures survey design to evaluate biodiversity literacy—understanding of biodiversity and knowledge of actions to help protect it—of zoo and aquarium visitors worldwide. Ours was the largest and most international study of zoo and aquarium visitors ever conducted. In total, 5661 visitors to 26 zoos and aquariums from 19 countries around the globe participated in the study. Aggregate biodiversity understanding and knowledge of actions to help protect biodiversity both significantly increased over the course of zoo and aquarium visits. There was an increase from previsit (69.8{\%}) to postvisit (75.1{\%}) in respondents demonstrating at least some positive evidence of biodiversity understanding. Similarly, there was an increase from previsit (50.5{\%}) to postvisit (58.8{\%}) in respondents who could identify actions to help protect biodiversity that could be achieved at an individual level. Our results are the most compelling evidence to date that zoo and aquarium visits contribute to increasing the number of people who understand biodiversity and know actions they can take to help protect biodiversity.

abstract = {Improved understanding of sub-national geographic variation and inequity in demographic and health indicators is increasingly recognized as central to meeting development goals. Data from DHS surveys are critical to monitoring progress in these indicators but are generally not used to support sub-national evaluation below the first-level administrative unit. This study explored the potential of geostatistical approaches for the production of interpolated surfaces from GPS cluster located survey data, and for the prediction of gridded surfaces at 5�5km resolution. The impact of DHS cluster displacement on these interpolated surfaces and the particular challenges of mapping in highly heterogeneous urban areas were also investigated. A flexible and robust geostatistical framework was proposed for generating and validating interpolated surfaces with georeferenced DHS survey data. The framework was tested by using four indicators from three different surveys. The accuracy of the interpolated surfaces varied between settings, and was driven by the spatial structure of each indicator and its relationship to available covariate data. The random displacement of DHS cluster geopositioning information reduced the precision of predicted maps, although the impact varied between settings and was generally modest. Over shorter distances, the greater degree of geographical heterogeneity that was associated with urban areas meant they were more sensitive to the impact of cluster displacement. High-resolution covariates and novel statistical approaches showed potential for improving mapping in these areas. This study demonstrated that, with appropriate modeling and validation, such data have broad utility for creating maps of a wide range of indicators that support improved geographically stratified decision-making. },

abstract = {The emergence of satellite sensors that can routinely observe millions of individual smallholder farms raises possibilities for monitoring and understanding agricultural productivity in many regions of the world. Here we demonstrate the potential to track smallholder maize yield variation in western Kenya, using a combination of 1-m Terra Bella imagery and intensive field sampling on thousands of fields over 2 y. We find that agreement between satellite-based and traditional field survey-based yield estimates depends significantly on the quality of the field-based measures, with agreement highest ([Formula: see text] up to 0.4) when using precise field measures of plot area and when using larger fields for which rounding errors are smaller. We further show that satellite-based measures are able to detect positive yield responses to fertilizer and hybrid seed inputs and that the inferred responses are statistically indistinguishable from estimates based on survey-based yields. These results suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to make predictions of smallholder agricultural productivity that are roughly as accurate as the survey-based measures traditionally used in research and policy applications, and they indicate a substantial near-term potential to quickly generate useful datasets on productivity in smallholder systems, even with minimal or no field training data. Such datasets could rapidly accelerate learning about which interventions in smallholder systems have the most positive impact, thus enabling more rapid transformation of rural livelihoods.},

abstract = {In the context of a changing climate, there is an urgent need to better understand the impact that weather disturbances have on food affordability in the developing world. While the influence of international markets on local food markets has received considerable attention, in contrast, the potential influence of weather disturbances on local food markets has received much less attention. In fact, local weather disturbances may have an adverse impact on the poorest households in developing countries. Here we quantify the short-run impact of both weather disturbances as well as international price changes on monthly food prices across 554 local commodity markets in 51 countries during the period between 2008 and 2012. We find that almost 20{\%} of local market prices were affected by domestic weather disturbances in the short run, 9{\%} by international price changes and 4{\%} by both domestic weather disturbances and international price changes during the period. An improved understanding of the magnitude and relative importance of weather disturbances and international price changes on rural economies will inform public policies that are designed to mitigate the impact of adverse weather disturbances.},

abstract = {Exploring extent and pattern of non-timber forest product (NTFP) income contribution to livelihoods of forest-adjacent people and the income related socio-economic factors is crucial in designing any development and conservation initiative. This paper examines NTFPs' role in contributing to the household economy and how different socio-economic factors may influence this contribution. Field methods involved quantitative and qualitative data collection of forest-adjacent households of Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. Results show that the contribution of different types of NTFPs to household economy varies in terms of subsistence and cash income. However, overall NTFP income is much higher than income from timber or firewood which indicates a larger dependence of the households on NTFPs. Income data analysis also finds that the poor households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs for their subsistence and cash income than the better-off households. Moreover, the study reveals that there are many other socio-economic factors at the household level such as number of members in household and total value of household implements and furniture that are significantly correlated with the NTFP income. More site-specific applied research on NTFP income and influential factors is necessary to generalize the findings for other parts of the world with similar socio-economic and environmental settings. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, ;40{\%} of children ,5 y old are stunted, with levels that have remained largely unchanged over the past 2 decades. Although the complex determinants of under-nutrition are well recognized, few studies have evaluated strategies that combine nutrition-specific, health-based approaches with food system– and livelihood-based interventions. Objective: We examined changes in childhood stunting and its determinants after 3 y of exposure to an integrated, multisector intervention and compared these changes with national trends. Design: A prospective observational trial was conducted across rural sites in 9 sub-Saharan African countries with baseline levels of childhood stunting .20{\%}. A stratified random sample of house-holds and resident children ,2 y old from villages exposed to the program were enrolled in the study. Main outcome measures in-cluded principal determinants of undernutrition and childhood stunting, which was defined as a height-for-age z score less than 22. National trends in stunting were generated from demographic and health surveys. Results: Three years after the start of the program in 2005–2006, consistent improvements were observed in household food security and diet diversity, whereas coverage with child care and disease-control interventions improved for most outcomes. The prevalence of stunting in children ,2 y old at year 3 of the program (2008– 2009) was 43{\%} lower (adjusted OR: 0.57; 95{\%} CI: 0.38, 0.83) than at baseline. The average national stunting prevalence for the coun-tries included in the study had remained largely unchanged over the past 2 decades. Conclusion: These findings provide encouraging evidence that a package of multisector interventions has the potential to produce re-ductions in childhood stunting.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between women's empowerment in agriculture and nutritional status among children under 2 years of age in rural Nepal. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of 4080 households conducted in 2012. Data collected included: child and maternal anthropometric measurements; child age and sex; maternal age, education, occupation and empowerment in agriculture; and household size, number of children, religion, caste and agro-ecological zone. Associations between the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI)'s Five Domains of Empowerment (5DE) sub-index and its ten component indicators and child length-for-age Z-scores (LAZ) and weight-for-length Z-scores (WLZ) were estimated, using ordinary least-squares regression models, with and without adjustments for key child, maternal and household level covariates. SETTING: Two hundred and forty rural communities across sixteen districts of Nepal. SUBJECTS: Children under 24 months of age and their mothers (n 1787). RESULTS: The overall WEAI 5DE was positively associated with LAZ ($\beta$=0{\textperiodcentered}20, P=0{\textperiodcentered}04). Three component indicators were also positively associated with LAZ: satisfaction with leisure time ($\beta$=0{\textperiodcentered}27, P{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}01), access to and decisions regarding credit ($\beta$=0{\textperiodcentered}20, P=0{\textperiodcentered}02) and autonomy in production ($\beta$=0{\textperiodcentered}10, P=0{\textperiodcentered}04). No indicator of women's empowerment in agriculture was associated with WLZ. CONCLUSIONS: Women's empowerment in agriculture, as measured by the WEAI 5DE and three of its ten component indicators, was significantly associated with LAZ, highlighting the potential role of women's empowerment in improving child nutrition in Nepal. Additional studies are needed to determine whether interventions to improve women's empowerment will improve child nutrition},

abstract = {Data sources on species distribution and range are typically expensive and time consuming to build, and traditional survey techniques often have spatial, temporal, or scale-related gaps. Social network sites, on the other hand, can provide massive amounts of cost effective data that may potentially yield information of direct benefit to supplement and understand ecological phenomena. Previous research explored using social network site content to enhance information collected by experts or professional surveys in domains including species distribution and land cover. However, the data quality and general suitability of social network sites data for answering questions related to species distribution and range is highly variable and this aspect of its value to science remains underexplored. In this research we investigate some causes of social network site data unreliability and explore how to mitigate them. We filter data points based on our estimates of reliability and relevance. We then use the filtered data to infer species ranges and distributions in concert with Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data. Our proposed methodology was applied to four Australian case studies including two insect pollinators, and two flowering plants. The case studies were chosen from Australia because of its unique geographical features, large landmass, sparse population, and the many tourists and residents who travel across it taking photos and sharing them through social media. We show that, despite some barriers, there are instances where the social network site data clearly complement the existing source, making our technique a valuable means of making repeatable, efficient additions to traditional species distribution data.},

Results indicate that knowledge of contraception is almost universal in most countries, yet knowledge of multiple methods of contraception remains considerably lower, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In most countries, a substantial proportion of women are not informed about other methods of contraception or about the potential side effects of their chosen method.

abstract = {To better understand the role of gender in intimate partner violence (IPV) outside the developed world, this report compares the experiences of married men and married women with spousal violence, the most common form of IPV, using data from two sub-Saharan African countries, Ghana and Uganda. The analysis finds that spousal violence is relatively common among both women and men in the two countries studied, but finds no evidence of gender symmetry. The findings of this report are unambiguous in demonstrating that the level, intensity, and severity of spousal violence against women are much greater than they are against men; that women are much more likely to be the victims and men the aggressors, even after controlling for other relevant factors; that when men do experience violence it is much more likely to be in a mutually violent relationship, while women are much more likely to be only the victims of violence; and that women and the children of women who experience violence are more likely to experience poor health outcomes than men or the children of men who experience violence. Experiencing violence for women is associated with several poor health outcomes for themselves and their children; whereas for men, perpetrating spousal violence is particularly associated with higher-risk sexual behaviors and some poor health outcomes for their children. When women are perpetrators of violence, their male partners do suffer at least some of the same health consequences as suffered by women victims. Based on the findings of this report, it is recommended that elimination of violence against women should remain the highest priority. Nonetheless, programs that are working to reduce violence and its negative health consequences should also take into consideration the fact that not all men are only perpetrators of spousal violence; some are also victims. },

abstract = {Background: Gender-based violence against women, including intimate partner violence (IPV), is a pervasive health and human rights concern. However, relatively little intervention research has been conducted on how to reduce IPV in settings impacted by conflict. The current study reports on the evaluation of the incremental impact of adding "gender dialogue groups" to an economic empowerment group savings program on levels of IPV. This study took place in north and northwestern rural C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire. Methods. Between 2010 and 2012, we conducted a two-armed, non-blinded randomized-controlled trial (RCT) comparing group savings only (control) to "gender dialogue groups" added to group savings (treatment). The gender dialogue group consisted of eight sessions that targeted women and their male partner. Eligible Ivorian women (18+ years, no prior experience with group savings) were invited to participate. 934 out of 981 (95.2{\%}) partnered women completed baseline and endline data collection. The primary trial outcome measure was an overall measure of past-year physical and/or sexual IPV. Past year physical IPV, sexual IPV, and economic abuse were also separately assessed, as were attitudes towards justification of wife beating and a woman's ability to refuse sex with her husband. Results: Intent to treat analyses revealed that compared to groups savings alone, the addition of gender dialogue groups resulted in a slightly lower odds of reporting past year physical and/or sexual IPV (OR: 0.92; 95{\%} CI: 0.58, 1.47; not statistically significant). Reductions in reporting of physical IPV and sexual IPV were also observed (not statistically significant). Women in the treatment group were significantly less likely to report economic abuse than control group counterparts (OR = 0.39; 95{\%} CI: 0.25, 0.60, p  {\textless} .0001). Acceptance of wife beating was significantly reduced among the treatment group ($\beta$ = -0.97; 95{\%} CI: -1.67, -0.28, p = 0.006), while attitudes towards refusal of sex did not significantly change Per protocol analysis suggests that compared to control women, treatment women attending more than 75{\%} of intervention sessions with their male partner were less likely to report physical IPV (a OR: 0.45; 95{\%} CI: 0.21, 0.94; p =.04) and report fewer justifications for wife beating (adjusted $\beta$ = -1.14; 95{\%} CI: -2.01, -0.28, p = 0.01); and both low and high adherent women reported significantly decreased economic abuse (a OR: 0.31; 95{\%} CI: 0.18, 0.52, p  {\textless}  0.0001; a OR: 0.47; 95{\%} CI: 0.27, 0.81, p = 01, respectively). No significant reductions were observed for physical and/or sexual IPV, or sexual IPV alone. Conclusions: Results from this pilot RCT suggest the importance of addressing household gender inequities alongside economic programming, because this type of combined intervention has potential to reduce levels of IPV. Additional large-scale intervention research is needed to replicate these findings. Trial registration.

This article presents improvements made in the fourth version of the Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4) data set. GPWv4 is a minimally modeled data set that uses uniform distribution to disaggregate census data from their native input units into a thirty arc-second global grid. Due to an increase in freely accessible census data from the 2010 round of censuses, eighty-seven countries are gridded at a higher administrative level than in the previous version, with a more than fivefold increase in the total number of census units outside of the United States. The resultant decrease in unit size has greatly improved the data set accuracy. Additionally, version 4 has expanded to include grids of age, sex, and urban–rural status. Obtaining high-resolution census data and matching census geography remains a priority for improving global gridded population data sets.},

Method PsychInfo, MEDLINE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched according to inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of 13 studies and qualitative analysis of 96 studies was conducted. Results Caregivers of children with chronic illness reported significantly greater general parenting stress than caregivers of healthy children (d = .40; p = {\textless}/=.0001). Qualitative analysis revealed that greater general parenting stress was associated with greater parental responsibility for treatment management and was unrelated to illness duration and severity across illness populations. Greater parenting stress was associated with poorer psychological adjustment in caregivers and children with chronic illness. Conclusion Parenting stress is an important target for future intervention. General and illness-specific measures of parenting stress should be used in future studies},

abstract = {Impact of Future Climate and Land Use Change on Non-timber Forest Product Provision in Benin, West Africa: Linking Niche-based Modeling with Ecosystem Service Values. Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) make a major contribution to the livelihoods of the West African population. However, these ecosystem services are threatened by climate and land use change. Our study aims at 1) the quantification and monetary mapping of important NTFPs, and 2) developing a novel approach to assess the impacts of climate and land use change on the economic benefits derived from these NTFPs. We performed household interviews in northern Benin to gather data on annual quantities of collected NTFPs from the three most important savanna tree species: Adansonia digitata, Parkia biglobosa, and Vitellaria paradoxa. Current market prices of the NTFPs were derived from local markets. We assessed the species' current and future (2050) occurrence probabilities by calibrating niche-based models with climate and land use data at a 0.1A degrees resolution (cell: similar to 10 x 10 km). To assess future economic gains and losses, respectively, we linked modeled species' occurrence probabilities with the spatially assigned monetary values. Highest current annual benefits are obtained from V. paradoxa (USD 54,111 A +/- 28,126/cell), followed by P. biglobosa (USD 32,246 A +/- 16,526/cell) and A. digitata (USD 9,514 A +/- 6,243/cell). The future simulations showed spatially varying impacts of environmental change. In particular A. digitata might benefit in some regions. However, large areas are projected to lose up to 50 {\%} of their current economic value by 2050 with regard to the three species. Our findings provide a first benchmark for local policy-makers to economically compare different land use options and adjust existing management strategies.},

abstract = {A focus on novel, confirmatory, and statistically significant results leads to substantial bias in the scientific literature. One type of bias, known as “p-hacking,” occurs when researchers collect or select data or statistical analyses until nonsignificant results become significant. Here, we use text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread throughout science. We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes beingmeasured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.},

abstract = {This study considers the two most pronounced shocks Senegalese subsistence farmers struggle with, namely increasing purchase prices and droughts. We assess the relationship of these self-reported shocks with child health in a multi-shock approach to account for concomitance of adverse events from the natural, biological, economic and health sphere. We employ a unique farming household panel dataset containing information on children living in poor, rural households in eight regions of Senegal in 2009 and 2011 and account for structural changes occurring between survey periods due to the large scale, national Nutrition Enhancement Program. By zooming in to the micro level we demonstrate that Senegal as a Sahelian country, mainly reliant on subsistence agriculture, is very vulnerable to climate variability and international price developments: According to our conservative estimates, the occurrence of a drought explains 25{\%} of the pooled weight-for-age standard deviation, income losses 31{\%}. Our multi-shock analysis reveals that the shocks are perceived as more severe in 2011 with droughts explaining up to 44{\%} of the standard deviation of child health, increased prices up to 21{\%}. Yet, the concomitance of droughts and increased prices after the structural change, i.e. the Nutrition Enhancement Program, indicates that the health of children experiencing both shocks in 2011 has improved. We argue that these results are driven by the increase in rural household income as theoretically outlined in the agricultural household model. Thus, adequate policy responses to shocks do not only depend on the nature but also on the concomitance of hazardous events.},

abstract = {Integrating health care services is thought to result in both cost savings and better outcomes through improving efficiency, quality, uptake and effectiveness of services. Integration is one of the seven core principles guiding the United States Global Initiative.  Although there is evidence on some aspects of the impacts of integration, such as increases in coverage rates for various interventions, there is little evidence regarding actual outcome variables. In this paper we utilize the empirical evidence available on the impact of integration on coverage rates and costs to model the impact of integrating services to prevent mother-to-child transmission with antenatal clinic sites on infant HIV infections averted, and also the impact of integrating family planning services into HIV care facilities. We calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for a number of different scenarios using the LiST model for Malawi, Mozambique and Uganda. We find that all of the integration strategies are cost-effective, with all of the scenarios except one being highly cost-effective. In fact, a majority of the scenarios examined actually report cost savings, particularly when the interactive and dynamic effects that are modeled across the different modules are included; for example, increasing family planning results in lower costs for providing health care to children, including immunization, because there are fewer children born. We conclude that, although few empirical results exist regarding the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios associated with integrating HIV and MNCH services, the modeled evidence confirms that there are, indeed, significant benefits to integration.},

The algorithm i) is built around a 0.05° climatology that incorporates satellite information to represent sparsely gauged locations, ii) incorporates daily, pentadal, and monthly 1981-present 0.05° CCD-based precipitation estimates, iii) blends station data to produce a preliminary information product with a latency of about 2 days and a final product with an average latency of about 3 weeks, and iv) uses a novel blending procedure incorporating the spatial correlation structure of CCD-estimates to assign interpolation weights. We present the CHIRPS algorithm, global and regional validation results, and show how CHIRPS can be used to quantify the hydrologic impacts of decreasing precipitation and rising air temperatures in the Greater Horn of Africa. Using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, we show that CHIRPS can support effective hydrologic forecasts and trend analyses in southeastern Ethiopia.},

Using bivariate and multivariate analysis, the authors examined the association between HIV prevalence and socio demographic characteristics, HIV-related knowledge, attitudes and sexual behavior. The multivariate analysis found strong associations between HIV serostatus and a few socio demographic and behavior variables. Among women, HIV prevalence is significantly associated with early age of sexual debut (by age 15), having more than one sexual partner, and being from Eastern region.  Men those who have moved within the last five years are more likely to be HIV positive than men who have in the same residence.  Young women age 15 to 19 and young men age 15 to 29 are significantly less likely to be HIV positive than older adults.  Knowledge of HIV prevention methods was not associated with HIV infection among men and only weakly associated with HIV infection among women.},

abstract = {This research compared social networking site (SNS) use in a collectivistic culture, China, and an individualistic culture, the United States (US). Over 400 college student participants from a Southwestern University in Chongqing, China, and 490 college participants from a Midwestern University in the US completed a survey about their use of SNSs-time spent, importance and motives for use. They then rated themselves on a variety of personal characteristics, namely the Big Five Personality factors, Loneliness, Shyness and Life Satisfaction. Results revealed cultural differences in SNS use. US participants spent more time in SNS, considered them to be more important and had more friends in SNSs than did Chinese participants. Self-ratings of personal characteristics also differed in the two cultures as did the personal characteristics that predicted SNS use. In general, personal characteristics were less effective in predicting SNS use in China than in the US. Findings suggest that in collectivistic cultures the importance of the family, friends and one's groups may be partly responsible for Chinese participants' lesser use of SNSs, whereas in individualistic cultures the importance of self and having more but less close and enduring friendships may be partly responsible for US participants' greater use of SNSs. Personal characteristics predicted SNS use in both cultures but were stronger predictors in an individualistic culture than in a collectivistic, consistent with the emphasis on self in the former and on family, friends and one's groups in the latter. Future research is needed to identify whether cultural values always take precedence over personal characteristics and motives in determining behavior in the virtual world. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper applies the methods of multi-dimensional mathematical demography to project national populations based on alternative assumptions on future, fertility, mortality, migration and educational transitions that correspond to the five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) storylines. In doing so it goes a significant step beyond past population scenarios in the IPCC context which considered only total population size. By differentiating the human population not only by age and sex—as is conventionally done in demographic projections—but also by different levels of educational attainment the most fundamental aspects of human development and social change are being explicitly addressed through modeling the changing composition of populations by these three important individual characteristics. The scenarios have been defined in a collaborative effort of the international Integrated Assessment Modeling community with the medium scenario following that of a major new effort by the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (IIASA, OEAW, WU) involving over 550 experts from around the world. As a result, in terms of total world population size the trajectories resulting from the five SSPs stay very close to each other until around 2030 and by the middle of the century already a visible differentiation appears with the range between the highest (SSP3) and the lowest (SSP1) trajectories spanning 1.5 billion. The range opens up much more with the SSP3 reaching 12.6 billion in 2100 and SSP1 falling to 6.9 billion which is lower than today's world population.},

abstract = {Fear of an upcoming woodfuel crisis caused by increasing woodfuel consumption in Bamako has had great influence on forestry policies aiming to reduce the impacts of urban woodfuel consumption. During the last 20-�years, energy gap analyses—the relationship between supply and demand of woodfuels—have been produced by the government of Mali to prove the impacts of woodfuel consumption in Bamako on surrounding woodlands. This study evaluates the methodology and data used to describe this woodfuel crisis through a comparison with regional and historical data. The results of the energy gap analyses are challenged by using different estimates of woody resource availability and woodfuel consumption to create best and worst case scenarios. These show either high surpluses or high deficits with a difference of 2.7 million tons/yr. The woodfuel system of Bamako is highly dynamic and it is very difficult to evaluate its sustainability using a simple methodology such as the energy gap analysis. Trends over the last 20-�years show a highly efficient woodfuel system that has adapted to changing circumstances, ensuring a continued affordable woodfuel supply for the urban residents. Better data on the productivity of West African woodlands and urban consumption are needed to avoid misinterpretations of the impacts of woodfuel harvesting on woody resources},

abstract = {Background: The major drivers of the obesity epidemic are much debated and have considerable policy importance for the population- wide prevention of obesity. Objective: The objective was to determine the relative contribu- tions of increased energy intake and reduced physical activity to the US obesity epidemic. Design: We predicted the changes in weight from the changes in estimated energy intakes in US children and adults between the 1970s and 2000s. The increased US food energy supply (adjusted for wastage and assumed to be proportional to energy intake) was apportioned to children and adults and inserted into equations that relate energy intake to body weight derived from doubly labeled water studies. The weight increases predicted from the equations were compared with weight increases measured in representative US surveys over the same period. Results: For children, the measured weight gain was 4.0 kg, and the predicted weight gain for the increased energy intake was identical at 4.0 kg. For adults, the measured weight gain was 8.6 kg, whereas the predicted weight gain was somewhat higher (10.8 kg). Conclusions: Increased energy intake appears to be more than suf- ficient to explain weight gain in the US population. A reversal of the increase in energy intake of '2000 kJ/d (500 kcal/d) for adults and of 1500 kJ/d (350 kcal/d) for children would be needed for a reversal to the mean body weights of the 1970s. Alternatively, large compen- satory increases in physical activity (eg, 110–150 min of walking/ d), or a combination of both, would achieve the same outcome. Population approaches to reducing obesity should emphasize a re- duction in the drivers of increased energy intake.},

abstract = {Background Previous studies on the association of malaria and stunted growth delivered inconsistent results. These conflicting results may be due to different levels of confounding and to considerable difficulties in elucidating a causal relationship. Randomized experiments are impractical and previous observational studies have not fully controlled for potential confounding including nutritional deficiencies, breastfeeding habits, other infectious diseases and socioeconomic status. Methods This study aims to estimate the causal effect between malaria episodes and stunted growth by applying a combination of Mendelian randomization, using the sickle cell trait, and matching. We demonstrate the method on a cohort of children in the Ashanti Region, Ghana. Results We found that the risk of stunting increases by 0.32 (P-value: 0.004, 95{\%} CI: 0.09, 1.0) for every malaria episode. The risk estimate based on Mendelian randomization substantially differs from the multiple regression estimate of 0.02 (P-value: 0.02, 95{\%} CI: 0.003, 0.03). In addition, based on the sensitivity analysis, our results were reasonably insensitive to unmeasured confounders. Conclusions The method applied in this study indicates a causal relationship between malaria and stunting in young children in an area of high endemicity and demonstrates the usefulness of the sickle cell trait as an instrument for the analysis of conditions that might be causally related to malaria. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {This report represents an effort to begin to fill the gaps in knowledge about the prevalence and covariates of fistula. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program has initiated the collection of data on the problem of fistula. This document reports on that effort, including a critique of data collection methods and an analysis of the collected data on fistula symptoms and their covariates.  This report demonstrates the effects that methodological approaches to survey implementation have on self-reported prevalence of severe incontinence and its covariates, and it underscores the need for careful consideration in sample selection and questionnaire construction. As a remedy for the suboptimal approaches to data collection that have been used in the past in the DHS program, this report presents a newly developed fistula survey module. Above all, all women are at risk for developing fistula, and, therefore, in the collection of prevalence data on symptoms of fistula, all women must have the opportunity to respond to a carefully considered set of questions, such as the module presented in this report. This report also serves to establish baseline levels of symptoms of fistula in several countries.  The findings of this report indicate that, to the degree that fistulae develop through obstetric causes, there is a critical need to re-emphasize the role of family planning in ensuring maternal health and survival. Finally, our results suggest that women who struggle with their labors do indeed seek medical care but too late to preclude severe morbidity. },

We study whether transfer programs in which funds are targeted to women decrease the incidence of spousal abuse. We examine the impact of the Mexican Oportunidades program on spousal abuse rates and threats of violence using data from a specialized survey. Beneficiary women are 40 percent less likely to be victims of physical abuse, but are more likely to receive violent threats with no associated abuse. This evidence is consistent with a model of decision-makers' interactions with asymmetric information in the male partner's gains to marriage, who can then use threats of violence to extract rents from their female partners. (JEL D82, J12, J16, K42, 015, 017) Acts of spousal violence are commonly considered coercive instruments at the disposition of individuals for the control of household resources or part ners' behaviors (Tauchen, Witte, and Long 1991; Bloch and Rao 2002; Felson and Messner 2000). Given the concerns that violence and coercion represent limitations on the freedom of an individual (Sen 1999), it is of particular concern that partner violence is quite prevalent, rising to approximately a quarter of the population in countries such as Haiti and Zambia (Kishor and Johnson 2004).1 This high preva lence across a large cross-section of countries has contributed to the recognition of spousal abuse as an important and global public policy concern.

abstract = {Ecosystem service approaches have become a prominent basis for planning and management. Cultural services and non-use values are included in all major typologies and present some of the most compelling reasons for conserving ecosystems, though many barriers exist to their explicit characterization. The values that conform least well to economic assumptions-variously lumped together with/as cultural services-have proven elusive in part because valuation is complicated by the properties of intangibility and incommensurability, which has in turn led to their exclusion from economic valuation. We argue that the effectiveness of the ecosystem services framework in decision-making is thwarted by (i) conflation of services, values, and benefits, and (ii) failure to appropriately treat diverse kinds of values. We address this challenge by (1) distinguishing eight dimensions of values, which have implications for appropriate valuation and decision-making; (2) demonstrating the interconnected nature of benefits and services, and so the ubiquity of intangible values; (3) discussing the implications of these propositions for ecosystem-services research; and (4) outlining briefly a research agenda to enable decision-making that is ecologically appropriate and socially just. Because many ecosystem services (co-)produce 'cultural' benefits, full characterization of services must address non-material values through methods from diverse social sciences. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

We investigated whether ecosystem services influence household wealth in semi-arid rural Mali, where climate variability and soil degradation were expected to regulate subsistence production. Mean rainfall, mean rain use efficiency, and rain use efficiency trends (a land degradation proxy) over the last 25. years were used to quantify ecosystem services. Asset wealth was measured in 2527 households from 65 villages spanning the range in ecosystem services. We evaluated effects on wealth, controlling for household size and demographics, ethnicity, village size, crop selection, and distance to open water and markets. While wealth variation was dominated by demographics, significant associations with ecosystem services were observed. Predicted household wealth increased significantly (20{\%}) with rainfall. Effects of rain use efficiency mean and trends were also significant, but only when conditioned on rainfall. With lower rainfall, wealth increased with mean rain use efficiency (+. 33{\%}) but decreased with rain use efficiency trend (- 22{\%}). With higher rainfall, however, wealth decreased with rain use efficiency (- 57{\%}) and increased markedly with rain use efficiency trend (+. 185{\%}).

Despite increasing investment in IPTp programs over the past decade, and despite high rates of attendance at ANC visits, use of IPTp remains low. To identify bottlenecks in IPTp delivery, service effectiveness analyses were performed on data from 16 DHS and Malaria Indictor Surveys (MIS) conducted between 2007 and 2011 in malaria-endemic countries in SSA. Multi-country, pooled, multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify determinants of IPTp delivery. Distributions of key determinants were compared for lower IPTp coverage countries and higher IPTp coverage countries. IPTp was effectively delivered for only 18{\%} of targeted women. Access to ANC services was not identified as a major reason for this low rate. However, levels of SP delivery to those attending ANC was low: 42{\%} of those attending one ANC visit received one SP dose, and 57{\%} of those attending two ANC visits received two SP doses. Determinants of IPTp use included number of ANC visits, receipt of other maternal health interventions, and malaria transmission level. Effectiveness of IPTp delivery systems varied substantially between higher and lower IPTp coverage countries. Women in higher coverage countries made fewer ANC visits, attended ANC for the first time earlier in gestation, and were more likely to use ANC services at public or religious facilities than were women in lower coverage countries. Results show that most pregnant women are obtaining ANC services at sufficient frequency and appropriate timing to permit IPTp delivery, but the intervention is not being effectively delivered in these settings. },

abstract = {Young women may disproportionately experience unmet need for family planning for a variety of reasons. While the concept of unmet need is straightforward? women wanting to delay or limit childbearing but not using a contraceptive method? the calculation of the indicator has changed several times, most recently in 2012. This study applies this revised algorithm in a comparative analysis of unmet need among young women using DHS data from 142 surveys in 61 developing countries. Specifically, it calculates current levels and trends in total demand and unmet need for family planning and its components, namely exposure to risk of pregnancy through marriage or non-marital sexual activity, fertility preferences, and use or non-use of contraception. An estimated 31 million young married women in study countries experience unmet need. Unmet need is, on average, greater among unmarried young women than among married peers; demand in this population approaches 90{\%} in all regions. Unmet need is often higher among younger women, rural women, women in poorer households, women with low education (except in Africa) and women who already have at least one child. Unmet need has declined over time for married and unmarried young women in most countries, except in West and Central Africa where trends are mixed. Over time, there generally has been an increase in the age at marriage but no clear increase in sexually activity among unmarried young women. Desired family size has decreased and use of modern contraceptive methods has increased in most countries. },

abstract = {Analysis of the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) findings from the perspective of caste, ethnicity, and regional identity (Bennett et al., 2008) was first conducted only after the third DHS round, which took place in 2006. The final reports in each round of the NDHS present extensive analysis from a gender, age, wealth, and geographic perspective but do not disaggregated the data from the perspective of caste, ethnicity, and regional identity. However, studies by Bennett and colleagues (2008), RTI (2008), and the Nepal Family Health Program II and New ERA (2010) have revealed important differences among caste/ethnic groups, exposing gaps in health services utilization and health outcomes that remain despite overall progress toward many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Such studies provide a valuable opportunity to focus policy attention on specific excluded or under-served groups of people.  This paper has two principal objectives. The first is to foster a better understanding of the disparities, in terms of caste, ethnicity, and regional identity, in access to and utilization of health services and in health outcomes by disaggregating the 2011 NDHS data for a selection of maternal and child health services and outcomes. Second, it examines the association of the caste, ethnicity, and regional identity of the respondents with use of selected health services and with health outcomes. Thus, the paper aims to help strengthen the evidence base on existing social disparities as a foundation for policy-making and programmatic decisions in the health sector.},

abstract = {This report estimates the number of maternal and child deaths that could be averted by satisfying the unmet need for contraception based on four high-risk fertility behavior categories, i.e., having a birth at too young an age, too old an age, with inadequate spacing, and at high parity. The data come from 45 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2012 with 691,362 non-pregnant women. Twenty-one percent of non-pregnant women have an unmet need for contraception due to their desires or their fertility risk, 5 percent for an unmet spacing method, and 16 percent for a limiting method. Another 20 percent are using a spacing method but have a need for a long-acting, permanent method of family planning. In total, 41 percent of women have a need for focused efforts by family planning programs. By satisfying the risk-based unmet need for contraception, over half of infant and under-five deaths could be averted, with 3.2 million deaths averted out of the 5.6 million deaths projected for 2015. Even more spectacular is the number of maternal deaths that could be averted, i.e., 109,000 out of the 155,000 projected, for a reduction of 70 percent. Only two of five women who need focused efforts and who visited a health facility in the preceding year were informed about family planning. It is thus incumbent upon national and private health programs and donors to serve the women with unmet needs, to cost-effectively avert maternal and child deaths, and to reach the Sustainable Development Targets 3.1 and 3.2. },

abstract = {AIM: This study provides regional estimates of forest cover in dry African ecoregions and the changes in forest cover that occurred there between 1990 and 2000, using a systematic sample of medium-resolution satellite imagery which was processed consistently across the continent.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLOCATION: The study area corresponds to the dry forests and woodlands of Africa between the humid forests and the semi-arid regions. This area covers the Sudanian and Zambezian ecoregions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A systematic sample of 1600 Landsat satellite imagery subsets, each 20 km × 20 km in size, were analysed for two reference years: 1990 and 2000. At each sample site and for both years, dense tree cover, open tree cover, other wooded land and other vegetation cover were identified from the analysis of satellite imagery, which comprised multidate segmentation and automatic classification steps followed by visual control by national forestry experts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Land cover and land-cover changes were estimated at continental and ecoregion scales and compared with existing pan-continental, regional and local studies. The overall accuracy of our land-cover maps was estimated at 87{\%}. Between 1990 and 2000, 3.3 million hectares (Mha) of dense tree cover, 5.8 Mha of open tree cover and 8.9 Mha of other wooded land were lost, with a further 3.9 Mha degraded from dense to open tree cover. These results are substantially lower than the 34 Mha of forest loss reported in the FAO's 2010 Global Forest Resources Assessment for the same period and area.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our method generates the first consistent and robust estimates of forest cover and change in dry Africa with known statistical precision at continental and ecoregion scales. These results reduce the uncertainty regarding vegetation cover and its dynamics in these previously poorly studied ecosystems and provide crucial information for both science and environmental policies.},

The analysis is based on 84 DHS and related surveys in 34 African countries. Level of education is measured as the Average Years of Schooling (AYS) for adults age 20 and older. Results show a marked increase in the level of education: the AYS increased from 0.7 years for men born in 1900 to 6.9 years for men born in 1985; for women, the AYS increased from 0.2 years in 1900 to 5.6 years in 1985. The gap between men and women AYS first increased for cohorts born before 1954 (gap of 2.5 years), then decreased to 1.4 years in 1985. The increase in level of education was not regular for cohorts born after 1930. In several countries the level of education remained steady for relatively long periods, and in some countries the level of education declined, especially for the men. The relationship between long-term trends in education and in fertility was weak and complex. Countries with a higher level of education in the mid-1970s had an earlier onset of fertility decline. However, the speed of the fertility transition, once underway, was not correlated with the level of education. After the onset of the fertility transition, the total fertility rate (TFR) had only a minor relationship with the level of education. In multivariate analysis, changes in level of education explained only a small part (13{\%}) of the fertility decline from 1975 to 2005. },

abstract = {The effective stewardship of health programs requires approaches that precisely target resources and interventions to meet population needs; one approach involves the use of geographic data modeling. The increased availability of DHS geographic data coincides with greater recognition by policymakers and researchers of the need for valid approaches to estimating health and population indicators for small administrative areas (i.e., smaller than the usual DHS regions) such as districts, counties, and other subprovincial units. In view of this need, The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program convened a meeting of key stakeholders, the DHS Spatial Interpolation Working Group, in June 2013 to discuss the use of geographic data from DHS population-based surveys for spatial interpolation. Two key themes emerged from the meeting: data considerations and methods considerations. Data considerations included the selection of appropriate indicators for spatial interpolation while methods considerations focused on specific spatial interpolation techniques. The most important criteria for selecting an interpolation method for use with DHS data are 1) an accurate and statistically rigorous map, and 2) inclusion of a corresponding map surface with estimates of the uncertainty or potential error associated with the spatial interpolation. In the coming years The DHS Program will be charged with the dual task of providing guidance on creating interpolated map surfaces using DHS data as well as guidance on the use and interpretation of these types of map surfaces. },

abstract = {Climate change and degradation of ecosystem services functioning may threaten the ability of current agricultural systems to keep up with demand for adequate and inexpensive food and for clean water, waste disposal and other broader ecosystem services. Human health is likely to be affected by changes occurring across multiple geographic and time scales. Impacts range from increasing transmissibility and the range of vectorborne diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, to undermining nutrition through deleterious impacts on food production and concomitant increases in food prices. This paper uses case studies to describe methods that make use of satellite remote sensing and Demographic and Health Survey data to better understand individual-level human health and nutrition outcomes. By bringing these diverse datasets together, the connection between environmental change and human health outcomes can be described through new research and analysis.},

The specifications of such data differ widely and therefore the harmonisation of data layers is a prerequisite to constructing detailed and contemporary spatial datasets which accurately describe population distributions. Such datasets are vital to measure impacts of population growth, monitor change, and plan interventions. To this end the WorldPop Project has produced an open access archive of 3 and 30 arc-second resolution gridded data. Four tiled raster datasets form the basis of the archive: (i) Viewfinder Panoramas topography clipped to Global ADMinistrative area (GADM) coastlines; (ii) a matching ISO 3166 country identification grid; (iii) country area; (iv) and slope layer. Further layers include transport networks, landcover, nightlights, precipitation, travel time to major cities, and waterways. Datasets and production methodology are here described.

abstract = {This report documents both socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of male respondents to the DHS surveys, as well as male attitudes, preferences, and behaviors relating to contraception, fertility, and health in 40 developing countries.   This report shows large regional variations in the reproductive preferences and behavior of men for both ever-married men and never-married men. A key finding of this report is that in all countries, never-married men (mostly youth age 15-24) are far more likely to know about modern contraceptive methods (particularly condoms) than to engage in sexual activity. This combination of knowledge and behavior suggests that there is currently a good foundation for youth-focused family planning and sexual health programs in most countries.  Another contribution of this report is its analysis of key indicators by the wealth index. While the relationship between wealth and outcomes of interest is typically in the expected direction, the tables presented here allow for a closer investigation of the gradients of inequality for each outcome. For example, the variation in knowledge of contraceptive methods among never-married men by the wealth index is minimal in Malawi but considerable in Guinea. These results are useful in identifying subpopulations that would obtain the most benefit from programmatic interventions.  In addition, the report present comparable data on men?s attitudes about gender roles, men?s communication with their spouses about important health issues, data on men?s health-related behaviors regarding their own health, and men?s knowledge of child health issues. },

abstract = {Wild edible trees are expected to play a significant role in the crop diversification programs and agroforestry development in Africa. In the present study, the diversity of wild food species and socio-economical factors that support farmers' choice for the species used in these systems were assessed. A number of selected sites in each of the 3 climatic zones of Benin were surveyed. Data were collected through a field exploration and a semi-structured survey among 435 selected households throughout the country, using a questionnaire. The most culturally important species ranked by locals were determined for each climatic zone and the relations between the targeted species in traditional agroforestry systems and the reasons which support peasants' choices were described through a Principal Component Analysis. A total of 43 wild edible trees were found in the traditional agroforestry systems of Benin during the survey. Traditional agroforestry systems in the Guineo-Congolian zone turned out to be the most diversified with 29 species followed by the Sudanian zone with 22 species and Sudano-Guinean zone with 16 species. The most culturally important wild edible trees in traditional agroforestry systems in the Guineo-Congolian zone were different from those identified in Sudanian and Sudano-Guinean zones. Three main reasons that support peasants' ambition to conserve or to grow wild edible trees in their field were: their contribution to food, their use in traditional medicine and ceremonies and the farmers' perception of their availability in natural vegetation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression {\&} path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote apopular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

Central to the framework is the analysis of the range of formal and informal organisational and institutional factors that influence sustainable livelihood outcomes.

abstract = {Most research linking global environmental change and food security focuses solely on agriculture: either the impact of climate change on agricultural production, or the impact of agriculture on the environment, e.g. on land use, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and/or biodiversity. Important though food production is, many other factors also need to be considered to understand food security. A recent international conference on "Environmental Change and Food Security: Bridging Science, Policy and Development for Adaptation" included a range of papers that embraced the multiple dimensions of the food systems that underpin food security. The major conclusion from the conference was that technical fixes alone will not solve the food security challenge. Adapting to the additional threats to food security arising from major environmental changes requires an integrated food system approach, not just a focus on agricultural practices. Six key issues emerged for future research: (i) adapting food systems to global environmental change requires more than just technological solutions to increase agricultural yields; (ii) tradeoffs across multiple scales among food system outcomes are a pervasive feature of globalized food systems; (iii) within food systems, there are some key underexplored areas that are both sensitive to environmental change but also crucial to understanding its implications for food security and adaptation strategies; (iv) scenarios specifically designed to investigate the wider issues that underpin food security and the environmental consequences of different adaptation options are lacking; (v) price variability and volatility often threaten food security; and (vi) more attention needs to be paid to the governance of food systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Globally, health has improved for many but not for everyone equally. That food and nutrition-related health is unequally distributed is a marker of societal failure. For some individuals, communities and even nations, it is a matter of not having enough food, of being unable to afford food and there being little nutritious food readily available. For others there is an over abundance of food but its nutritional quality is compromised, access to healthy food is poor and cost of food is high relative to other commodities. Human development and poverty reduction in the Asia Pacific region cannot be achieved without improving nutrition in an equitable way. There is no biological reason for the scale of difference in health, including diet-related health that is observed in the Asia Pacific region. That it exists is unethical and inequitable. Asymmetric economic growth, unequal improvements in daily living conditions, unequal distribution of technical developments and suppression of human rights have seen health inequities perpetuate and worsen, particularly over the last three decades. Addressing diet-related health inequities requires attention to the underlying structural drivers and inequities in conditions of daily living that disempower individuals, social groups and even nations from the pursuit of good nutrition and health. These are matters of economic and social policy at the global, regional and national level.},

This report uses nationally representative data on HIV testing uptake from 47 DHS and AIS surveys in 29 sub-Saharan African countries conducted between 2003 and 2011. We examine four aspects of HIV testing uptake: (1) uptake by individual and household characteristics; (2) increases in uptake over time; (3) the role of HIV testing during ANC in overall uptake; and (4) uptake by HIV serostatus. While uptake of HIV testing has increased in every country studied, the gains have been uneven. Regardless of any male-female testing differential in the earliest survey in a country, the most recent survey in every country indicates that women are more likely than men to have ever been tested for HIV. This disparity appears to reflect the relative success of increased testing uptake during antenatal care (ANC). Even so, in the median country, the majority of adults have never been tested for HIV. While seropositive individuals are more likely to have ever been tested for HIV, in 16 of 25 countries studied with respect to serostatus the majority of HIV-positive men and women have no way of knowing their HIV status because they have never been tested. Scaling up access and outreach to testing among underserved populations in particular, including men in rural areas, remains an important frontier to achieving universal access to treatment and support in most countries. },

abstract = {This report is a review of reproductive preferences in 60 countries based on data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 1998 and 2008.  Several measures of preferences are used: the number of children considered ideal, the proportion of women who want no more children, the planning status of recent births, and the Wanted Total Fertility Rate.  For those countries that have conducted more than one survey, trends in reproductive preferences have been documented.  For a subset of mostly sub-Saharan African countries, men?s reproductive attitudes are also described.  A review of the most recent DHS estimates of levels and trends of reproductive preferences indicates that the number of children desired is declining in most of the developing world with the exception of some countries in western and middle sub-Saharan Africa. In most of the 60 countries reviewed, there has been a decline in the Total Fertility Rate which is due largely to a decline in the number of children wanted rather than to a reduction of unwanted births.  A special analysis of unmet need and reproductive preferences focuses on several countries in sub-Saharan countries where unmet need is low because preferences are very high (Chad, Guinea, Mozambique, Niger and Nigeria).  The number of children desired is associated with child mortality, Muslim affiliation, women?s education and empowerment, and exposure to the mass media.  },

We use multiple-decrement life tables to calculate contraceptive failure rates and simulate alterations of the contraceptive method mix  in each country. Results show the  contribution of contraceptive failure to unintended births and induced abortions to be substantial. On average, 31{\%} of births from unintended pregnancies and 53{\%} of induced abortions resulted from contraceptive failure. Simulations show that if all women who currently use contraceptives began using the most effective (long-acting or permanent) method to meet their fertility intentions, the level of unintended births would decrease by an average of 27{\%}, and the level of induced abortion could be cut in half.},

abstract = {In developing countries, forests play an important role in supplying goods and services. These ecosystems are under many stresses due to unsustainable management practices, lack of clarity on tenure and access rights, and persistent pressure for land-use change. Climate change is exacerbating the impact of these stresses on both forest ecosystems and forest dependent people. What are the current forest coping strategies of different livelihoods? What is the role of forest ecosystems in increasing the resilience of rural communities?Over a two-year period, an interdisciplinary team of civil society researchers and development practitioners made an attempt to address these questions in a systematic manner through the use of the CRiSTAL tool - Community-based Risk Screening Tool for Adaptation and Livelihoods - in different countries. For this publication, case studies conducted in three African countries -Zambia, Mali and Tanzania - are presented. Particular focus is given to the coping strategies used forest, livestock and agriculture based livelihoods. In all cases, forest ecosystems provided key goods and services during extreme events (droughts and floods) and become key assets for reducing vulnerability in the context of climate change However, issues related to unclear land tenure, as well as legislation forbidding forest use, strengthen underlying conflicts over natural resources and therefore increase the high pressure on forest ecosystems and thus the overall vulnerability of poor rural communities. This paper analyzes the corresponding challenges and offers a number of recommendations for decision- and policy-makers, on how to support local adaptation to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper we review the associations between maternal and child undernutrition with human capital and risk of adult diseases in low-income and middle-income countries. We analysed data from five long-standing prospective cohort studies from Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa and noted that indices of maternal and child undernutrition (maternal height, birthweight, intrauterine growth restriction, and weight, height, and body-mass index at 2 years according to the new WHO growth standards) were related to adult outcomes (height, schooling, income or assets, offspring birthweight, body-mass index, glucose concentrations, blood pressure). We undertook systematic reviews of studies from low-income and middle-income countries for these outcomes and for indicators related to blood lipids, cardiovascular disease, lung and immune function, cancers, osteoporosis, and mental illness. Undernutrition was strongly associated, both in the review of published work and in new analyses, with shorter adult height, less schooling, reduced economic productivity, and-for women-lower offspring birthweight. Associations with adult disease indicators were not so clear-cut. Increased size at birth and in childhood were positively associated with adult body-mass index and to a lesser extent with blood pressure values, but not with blood glucose concentrations. In our new analyses and in published work, lower birthweight and undernutrition in childhood were risk factors for high glucose concentrations, blood pressure, and harmful lipid profiles once adult body-mass index and height were adjusted for, suggesting that rapid postnatal weight gain-especially after infancy-is linked to these conditions. The review of published works indicates that there is insufficient information about long-term changes in immune function, blood lipids, or osteoporosis indicators. Birthweight is positively associated with lung function and with the incidence of some cancers, and undernutrition could be associated with mental illness. We noted that height-for-age at 2 years was the best predictor of human capital and that undernutrition is associated with lower human capital. We conclude that damage suffered in early life leads to permanent impairment, and might also affect future generations. Its prevention will probably bring about important health, educational, and economic benefits. Chronic diseases are especially common in undernourished children who experience rapid weight gain after infancy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the early 1990s, industrialised Cuba was plunged into crisis as it lost its major source of food, fuel and agricultural input supplies with the demise of the Soviet bloc. Within a decade, the country had recovered sufficiently to double agricultural production, increase calorific availability by 25 per cent, and maintain a consistent and equitable social food programme. Given the continued shortfall of petroleum imports into the country, this was a major achievement, yet it is little studied or used as a learning example for other nations struggling with food insecurity. This article presents the results of a unique study into Cuban agriculture and its food system at the end of the 1990s, identifying the main mechanisms implemented by Cuba to regain its food security status. It argues that the lack of interest in the Cuban experience by the international community indicates that political bias may be causing us to ignore lessons that could contribute to achieving food security in other countries.},

The prevalence was much higher in urban areas, among women, and among adults who had multiple sexual partners and non-regular partners. Using data from the two recent Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys, conducted in 2000 and 2005, this study examined changes in key HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, and sexual behavior indicators. Significant changes in selected indicators during 2000 and 2005 were determined using the t-test. The study revealed a number of encouraging signs that HIV/AIDS prevention programs are having the intended effects. Knowledge of HIV prevention methods increased in recent years, and there has been considerable increase in youth practicing sexual abstinence. Fewer adults reported having multiple partners and the proportion reporting sexual intercourse with a non-spousal partner decreased substantially. Although, the overall use of condoms remained low, use of condoms with non-spousal partners increased substantially. However, there has been little change in the proportion of women who know that HIV can be transmitted from mother to child, indicating a need for intensified communication program efforts on PMTCT targeting women. },

abstract = {Poor people living in high-risk environments live continuously with uncertainty which often threatens their livelihoods. They have therefore developed effective means of predicting and responding to large fluctuations in rainfall, harvest levels and natural resource production. These methods of prediction and response often outperform conventional early warning systems promoted by donors and governments, and yet are rarely considered in the conception and implementation of food security programmes. The book explains how food and livelihood insecurity can be predicted in order to identify ways of mitigating the threat of famine. The starting point is the way in which different people in Inner Niger Delta and surrounding drylands in Mali have adapted their livelihoods to confront successive droughts, creeping impoverishment and food insecurity. Data are derived from a local food monitoring system (the Suivi Alimentaire Delta Seno), which challenges conventional approaches to famine early warning, by focusing on how people feed themselves, rather than how they fail to do so. Conventional famine early warning systems are unable to detect changes, and as such the implications for food security planning and famine early warning are considerable. Food security in Mali has been characterized in the 1980s by liberalization of cereal markets and famine early warning to inform about distributions of free food aid. The study concludes by outlining a simplified methodology for monitoring livelihood security, to be used as a basis for developing contingency plans and regional food security planning capacities and policies.},

abstract = {In many community time series studies on the effect of particulate air pollution on mortality, particulate air pollution is modeled additively. In this study, we investigated the interaction between daily particulate air pollution and daily mean temperature in Cook County, Illinois and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, using data for the period 1987-1994. This was done through the use of joint particulate air pollution-temperature response surfaces and by stratifying the effect of particulate air pollution on mortality by temperature. Evidence that the effect of particulate air pollution on mortality may depend on temperature is found. However, the results were sensitive to the number of degrees of freedom used in the confounder adjustments, the particulate air pollution exposure measure, and how the effects of temperature on mortality are modeled. The results were less sensitive to the estimation method used - generalized linear models and natural cubic splines or generalized additive models and smoothing splines. The results of this study suggest that in community particulate air pollution mortality time series studies the possibility of an interaction between daily particulate air pollution and daily mean temperature should be considered. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {While many countries have developed and expanded efforts to sustain and enhance the protection of biodiversity, the effectiveness of such programs, as well as the manner in which funds are distributed, has been questioned. We examined funding allocation decisions for species conservation in Spain at different governmental scales. Several factors that may impact conservation spending patterns and policy decisions were examined, including available scientific data, current scientific policies, and public awareness and perceptions of conservation needs. Our analyses revealed a strong connection between existing conservation policies and scientific information, research priorities and public concern. We found that there is a substantial bias in the taxa that are studied, the funding levels for those studies and public policy which triggers and supports the studies. The relationships, however, are not strictly cause and effect, but are instead enmeshed in a complex feed-back system in which conventional scientific activity acts as the main driver but is itself influenced by both policy and public perception. By acknowledging both the essential role of science in this system and the critical factors that can influence the acquisition of scientific information, a constructive dialog can be established that will propel conservation activities to a more productive and environmentally sound outcome. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A major challenge for ecologists has long been to develop a model to explain the coexistence of grasses and trees in the savanna. The recent shift in emphasis to non-equilibrium-based theories has resulted in a rethinking of this problem. As resource allocation models have been replaced by demographic ones, the focus has shifted to plant life histories. The tree/grass ratio is now conceptualized as a function of disturbance history. Empirical studies demonstrate that repeat fires trap tree sprouts in perpetual juvenile states. Ecologists suggest natural pathways for juveniles to escape, reach maturity, and maintain tree/grass ratios. This study documents how long-fallow agriculture serves as an anthropogenic pathway. The study compares tree cover on long-fallow and unfarmed savanna plots in southern Mali where burning is annual. Tree height, girth, and species were recorded for 29 quadrats. The results demonstrate a significant difference in the size, number, and species of trees; those on fallow plots were taller, more numerous, and more diverse. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Such reductions in the level of soil organic matter have resulted in decreased soil productivity. The addition of organic materials either in the form of manures or crop residue has beneficial effects on the soils' chemical and physical properties. For many of the countries in this region, the amounts of nutrients in crops and crop residue are often several orders of magnitude higher than the quantity of the same nutrients applied as fertilizers. The return of the crop residue for soil fertility improvement cannot be overstressed.

A total of 52 developing countries with surveys since 2001 in the DHS project are included. On average, 32 percent of married women are currently using a modern contraceptive method, ranging from 9 percent in West and Middle Africa to 51 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The total demand for family planning ranges from 41 percent in West and Middle Africa to 80 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The use of modern contraception has generally been rising, but the changes are slight in West and Middle Africa, where contraceptive use for spacing rather than for limiting births continues to dominate. A series of multivariate analyses of factors affecting the use of modern contraception versus having an unmet need shows, with some exceptions, a positive association with education and with wealth. Unmet need was also assessed for unmarried women in countries where they were included in DHS surveys. In Latin America and the Caribbean and in East and Southern Africa, about one-third of unmarried sexually active women are classified as having an unmet need, while in West and Middle Africa about half are in this category. Trends in the percentage of sexually active unmarried women who are not using modern contraception show a continuing and near universal decline from earlier years. },

abstract = {Natural tropical forests are highly diverse and are known to contribute to forest-based services such as pollination of nearby crops. Landscape changes cause spatial and temporal bee community changes, but consequences how the community changes affect pollination is not well analyzed. This paper addresses the effects of rainforest distance and on site flower resources in agro-forests on spatial and temporal variation in pollinator communities and the consequences for coffee pollination. The study was conducted in 24 agro-forests dominated by coffee and cacao in Sulawesi, Indonesia differing in their distance to rainforest margin of the Lore-Lindu National Park and in flower density and its temporal variation. In all agro-forests, (1) transect surveys of the understory were obtained over a five-month period to assess bee community compositional similarity, bee diversity, and the temporal variation in bee diversity; and (2) coffee flower visitors were observed and open and bagged pollination treatments conducted over one week of coffee blooming to assess bee diversity and the spatial variation in bee diversity and coffee pollination. Mean number of shared species of the understory ranged between 40 and 60{\%} per agro-forest and was higher in agro-forests nearby the rainforest than in agro-forests with a minimal distance of 500 m isolated from the rainforest. Mean species richness in the understory and in coffee flowers decreased with rainforest isolation and increased with flower resource availability. Temporal variation in bee species richness of the understory and spatial variation of the coffee flower-visiting bee species richness per agro-forest increased with forest distance. The variation in bee species richness decreased the mean and increased the spatial variation in bee-pollinated coffee fruit set per agro-forest. In conclusion, crops grown near intact rainforests and which profit from the pollination by many species may fluctuate less in bee-pollinated fruit set across crop plants than crop plants in isolated agriculture that receive low or even single species pollination services. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper hypothesizes that there is a common core to the household food insecurity experience that goes beyond insufficient food quantity and that transcends culture. The paper for the first time employs an exploratory approach to identify cross-cultural commonalities of the food insecurity experience as captured in 22 scales and related ethnographies derived from 15 different countries. The constant comparative method was used to code elements of the food insecurity experience expressed in the ethnographies and to regroup them into domains and subdomains. This typology was then applied to ascertain which experiential domains and subdomains were measured (or not) across all 22 studies. Survey data from 11 of the studies were then analyzed to assess similarities in the relative frequency with which culturally diverse households responded to questionnaire items related to these common domains/subdomains. The analysis confirmed that insufficient food quantity, inadequate food quality, and uncertainty and worry about food were a significant part of the food insecurity experience in all sampled cultures; concerns about social unacceptability emerged in all ethnographic accounts. Several subdomains were identified, such as concern over food safety and meal pattern disruption, with potentially important consequences for physical and psychological well-being. The comparative survey data showed that the relative frequency at which populations responded to domain- related questionnaire items was similar across all but a few cultures. Future food insecurity assessments should consider these core domains and subdomains as the starting point for measures that can generate rich information to inform food security policies and programs.},

Case studies from Cuba, Brazil, Philippines, and Africa are presented to demonstrate how the agroecological development paradigm based on the revitalization of small farms which emphasizes diversity, synergy, recycling and integration, and social processes that value community participation and empowerment, proves to be perhaps one of the only viable options to meet present and future food needs. Given the present and predicted near future climate, energy and economic scenarios, agroecology has emerged as one of the most robust pathways towards designing biodiverse, productive, and resilient agroecosystems available today.},

abstract = {t. Likelihood-based regression models such as the normal linear regression model and the linear logistic model, assume a linear (or some other parametric) form for the covariates X1, X2, *--, Xp. We introduce the class of generalized additive models which replaces the linear form E fjXj by a sum of smooth functions E sj(Xj). The sj(.)'s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor q = E fjXj is replaced by the additive predictor E sj(Xj); hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely auto- matic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model},

abstract = {Zimbabwe is ranked among the 40 countries in the world with high maternal mortality. HIV/AIDS is the leading indirect cause of maternal mortality in Zimbabwe, accounting for 26{\%} of the recorded maternal deaths. HIV-positive pregnant women face increased health risks because of their status, and it is crucial that they adhere to the appropriate antenatal care (ANC) protocol and deliver under skilled care in a health facility. In this study we hypothesized that HIV-positive pregnant women are more likely to use maternal health services compared with HIV-negative pregnant women. Using secondary data from the 2010-11 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS), we examined the association between knowledge of HIV status and use of maternal health services.   The study selected 2,362 women age 15-49 who gave birth in the three years preceding the ZDHS, were tested for HIV during ANC and received the results. Two variables were used to measure use of maternal health services: number of ANC visits and place of delivery. Knowledge of HIV status was determined using data from the survey questions that asked women if they were tested for HIV and received the test results during their last pregnancy, as well as using the actual HIV test results obtained at the time of the 2010-11 ZDHS. We performed chi-square tests and logistic regression to determine association.  The results indicate that there is no significant association between use of maternal health services and knowledge of HIV status. HIV-positive women are not different from their HIV-negative counterparts in use of maternal health services. The fact that the results do not support the study hypothesis raises serious concerns about implications for programmes designed to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV and the overall fight to prevent maternal deaths.},

This paper sets out to answer this controversial question using panel data from 63 developing countries over 1970-1996. This paper gives evidence in support of a statistically significant and strong positive impact of national food availability on child nutrition, finding that increased food supplies have resulted in significant reductions in malnutrition since the 1970s despite population increases over the period. However, per-capita food supplies have a declining marginal impact: Their effect is quite strong for countries with very low food availability (e.g., most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia), but weak or non-existent for those with high levels (e.g., most countries in the Near East and North Africa). Further, non-food factors, such as women's education and status and the quality of health environments, are also important determinants of children's nutritional status. Depending on the state of food availability in any particular geographic area and relative costs, these factors may merit greater priority in policies to reduce malnutrition. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The HIV status of cohabiting partners can be described as discordant if one partner is HIV-negative and the other is HIV-positive. This report assesses the prevalence of discordance and the level of HIV risk from discordance by locating discordant couples within a larger pattern of association among sex (male or female), having a cohabiting partner, and the HIV status of individual men and women. This three-way association varies by age, place of residence, educational level, and wealth quintile.  Data for the analysis come from DHS surveys in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Cameroon, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The countries were selected because their HIV prevalence exceeds 4{\%}. Their most recent surveys were conducted between 2006 and 2012. Because DHS data are cross-sectional, and provide little or no information about date or source of HIV infection, duration of cohabitation, disruption due to death or dissolution of relationships, etc., the study is largely descriptive. Non-cohabiting partnerships are not represented in this analysis. It is found that in virtually all countries and subpopulations, there are far fewer discordant couples than would be expected under a random model. The two possible types of discordant couples are nearly always of equal size, regardless of differences between the HIV prevalences of men and women in the larger population. The percentage of HIV-negative individuals who have elevated risk of seroconversion because of discordance with a cohabiting partner ranges from 1{\%} to 4{\%}. The risks are similar for men and women.},

We show connections to the familiar spline penalty on the integral of the squared second derivative. A short overview of B-splines, of their construction and of penalized likelihood is presented. We discuss properties of penalized B-splines and propose various criteria for the choice of an optimal penalty parameter.

Method: The analysis was based on the data from the Women?s Questionnaire and the calendar data from the 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). Postpartum contraceptive use was analyzed from calendar data among postpartum women whose most recent birth was between January 2003 and one full year before the date of interview in 2008. The study employed the bivariate (nonparametric test) and multivariate (logistic regression model) methods to investigate the association between the outcome variable (postpartum use of contraception) and several independent variables reflecting use of maternal health care services (number of antenatal care visits, delivery in a health facility, and timing of the first postnatal check-up).  Results: Overall, 8 percent of women used a modern method of contraception during the postpartum period. Almost half of the postpartum women (43 percent) made the WHO-recommended minimum number of four antenatal care visits. Only 35 percent of postpartum women delivered in a health facility. Just 40 percent of the women received a postnatal check-up within six weeks after last childbirth.  The use of maternal health services (ANC visits and timing of postnatal check-up) is significantly associated with the use of a modern method of contraception during the postpartum period. Other significant predictors of the use of a modern method in the postpartum period include region, education, the household wealth index, and exposure to family planning messages.  The findings suggest that contraceptive use among postpartum women will increase substantially if more women use maternal health care services, especially for antenatal care and postnatal care.},

The emphasis is on trends in unmet need and the demand for family planning in 58 developing countries. In addition to the standard measure, estimates of the unmet need for modern methods have also been included.   The important finding is that the proportion of women with unmet need has declined in most countries except in sub-Saharan Africa where little change is apparent in 15 of the 23 countries with available trend data. Moreover, in the least developed countries, there are significant proportions of married women who are in need and have never used contraception, and who say that they do not intend to use any method. The proportion in this category has declined in many countries but remains a serious challenge in others. The proportion of the total demand for family planning that has been satisfied ranges from 11 percent in Chad to 94 percent in Vietnam. In sub-Saharan Africa, an average of 43 percent of demand for all methods is satisfied, while in the other regions the average is 77 percent.

Their vulnerability to climate change comes both from being predominantly located in the tropics, and from various socioeconomic, demographic, and policy trends limiting their capacity to adapt to change. However, these impacts will be difficult to model or predict because of (i) the lack of standardised definitions of these sorts of farming system, and therefore of standard data above the national level, (ii) intrinsic characteristics of these systems, particularly their complexity, their location-specificity, and their integration of agricultural and nonagricultural livelihood strategies, and (iii) their vulnerability to a range of climate-related and other stressors. Some recent work relevant to these farming systems is reviewed, a conceptual framework for understanding the diverse forms of impacts in an integrated manner is proposed, and future research needs are identified.},

abstract = {The influence of dispersed trees on microclimatic conditions, gas exchange and productivity of maize (Zea mays L.) in a Grevillea robusta-based agroforestry system in semi-arid Kenya was examined to test the hypothesis that the benefits of shade seen in savannah ecosystems may be outweighed by competition for below-ground resources. Meristem temperature, cumulative thermal time, intercepted radiation, spatial distribution of shade and gas exchange were determined for maize grown as sole crops, in an agroforestry system, or under shade nets providing 25 or 50{\%} reductions in incident radiation to discriminate between effects of shade and below-ground competition. The major benefit of shade was to reduce exposure to the supra-optimal temperatures experienced in many tropical regions, and which are predicted to become increasingly common by climate change models. However, although trees decreased photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) incident on understorey maize by ca. 30{\%}, the yield reduction was much greater than in the 25{\%} shade net treatment in four seasons providing contrasting rainfall. Maize yield was unaffected by 50{\%} artificial shade in the driest season (168 mm) but decreased with increasing shade when rainfall was high (628 mm). Shade reduced meristem temperature and delayed flowering by 5-24 days depending on treatment and seasonal rainfall. Thermal time to flowering in the agroforestry system doubled from 600 to 1200 °C day as rainfall decreased. Photosynthetic and transpiration rates for understorey maize were similar to the 25 and 50{\%} shade treatments when rainfall was high, but were ca. 10{\%} of those for unshaded sole maize in dry seasons. PPFD-saturated photosynthetic rate was initially similar in all treatments but fell sharply in the agroforestry system as the season progressed. Radiation conversion coefficients did not differ between unshaded sole and understorey maize. The results suggest that the ameliorative influence of tree shade was greater in low rainfall seasons, as in savannah systems, but that potential benefits were outweighed by below-ground competition. This may be managed by root-pruning trees. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In Ethiopia, the proportion of births that occur at home remains high, and skilled health professionals attend very few births. Considering these facts, this study examined factors determining institutional delivery care service utilization in Ethiopia, using data from two rounds of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in Ethiopia (2000 and 2005). Using the binomial logistic regression model, the study showed that women residing in urban areas, women with secondary and higher education, and women from the wealthiest households were most likely to utilize delivery care services. In addition, the study found that four or more antenatal visits and birth order of children were significant predictors of institutional delivery. Further, the study showed that delivery service utilization did not change significantly between the two survey years.  Based on these findings, it can be recommended that there should be progress toward a health education program that enables more women to utilize maternal health care services, including delivery care. To meet the goal, this program should target specific groups, including rural and uneducated women, through appropriate media. It should also target mothers with higher birth orders and should encourage more use of antenatal care during pregnancy. Finally, improvement in the socioeconomic status of women is crucial to enabling more women to seek care during pregnancy and delivery.},

British students were more likely to use computers for study purposes than Chinese students, but Chinese students were more self-confident about their advanced computer skills. Significant gender differences were also found in both national groups. Men in both countries were more likely than women to use email or 'chat' rooms. Men played more computer games than women; Chinese men being the most active games players. Men in both countries were more self-confident about their computer skills than women, and were more likely to express the opinion that using computers was a male activity and skill than were women.

abstract = {By linking Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) and Service Provision Assessment (SPA) surveys, this study measures the extent to which women?s contraceptive use is associated with regional facility-based family planning supply and service environment in four African countries: Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. The outcome variable, drawn from DHS surveys, is women?s current use of any modern contraceptive method. Supply and service environment variables are drawn from SPA surveys. Supply is measured as the average number of methods provided and available in facilities in the region.  Family planning service environment is measured by an index score created based on a number of variables that are selected based on the availability of data and their relevance to providing good-quality family planning services in a facility.    Multivariate regression analysis finds that an average increase of one contraceptive method available in a region increases women?s odds of using modern contraception by 50 percent if family planning facility density in the region and other individual-level variables are held constant. Women in regions with a more favorable service environment (as measured by a higher service environment score) in facilities are more likely to use a modern contraceptive method. The analysis also suggests that regional-level factors significantly contribute to the between-region variation in contraceptive use. The increased proportion of variation explained by adding regional contraceptive supply and service environment variables to the model is 18 percent and 27 percent, respectively. },

Women who married after the 1994 genocide experienced significantly increased domestic violence and reduced decision-making power relative to women who married before, with a greater effect for women in localities with high genocide intensity. Additionally, exposure to genocide reduced the household education expenditure in families of women who were of marriageable age after the genocide relative to families of older women. Part of the effect of the genocide on domestic violence was driven by changes in the marriage market sex ratios across localities and over time, which were mainly induced by the conflict. Through changes in intra-household bargaining, civil conflicts may impair the well-being of women and children in the long-term.},

This study contributes to the literature on organized climate scepticism by providing the first systematic overview of conservative think tank sceptical discourse in nearly 15 years. Specifically, we (1) compile the largest corpus of contrarian literature to date, collecting over 16,000 documents from 19 organizations over the period 1998-2013; (2) introduce a methodology to measure key themes in the corpus which scales to the substantial increase in content generated by conservative think tanks over the past decade; and (3) leverage this new methodology to shed light on the relative prevalence of science- and policy-related discussion among conservative think tanks. We find little support for the claim that "the era of science denial is over"-instead, discussion of climate science has generally increased over the sample period.},

Results suggest that women's empowerment is more strongly associated with the quality of infant and young child feeding practices and only weakly associated with child nutrition status. Women's empowerment in credit decisions is positively and significantly correlated with women's dietary diversity, but not body mass index. This suggests that improved nutritional status is not necessarily correlated with empowerment across all domains, and that these domains may have different impacts on nutrition.},

Results reveal that forest environmental income represents on average 22{\%} of the total income in the population sampled. The main sources of forest environmental income are fuelwood, wild foods and fodder. Forest environmental income has a strong equalizing effect on local income distribution. Income diversification declined with total income; diversification did, however, increase with dependence on forest resources up to a point, beyond which diversification declined. The partial or complete omission of environmental income in current poverty assessments may lead to an underestimation of rural income and, under certain circumstances, to flawed policies and interventions. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Two of the most prominent frameworks to develop in ecology over the past decade are metacommunity ecology, which seeks to characterize multispecies distributions across space, and occupancy modeling, which corrects for imperfect detection in an effort to better understand species occurrence patterns Although their goals are complementary, metacommunity theory and statistical occupancy modeling methods have developed independently. For instance, the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework uses species occurrence data to classify metacommunity structure and link it to underlying environmental gradients. While the efficacy of this approach relies on the quality of the data, few studies have considered how imperfect detection, which is widespread in ecological surveys and the major focus of occupancy modeling, affects the outcome. We introduce a framework that integrates multispecies occupancy models with the current EMS framework, detection error-corrected EMS (DECEMS). This method offers two distinct advantages. First, DECEMS reduces bias in characterizing metacommunity structure by using repeated surveys and occupancy models to disentangle species-specific occupancy and detection probabilities, ultimately bringing metacommunity structure classification into a more probabilistic framework. Second, occupancy modeling allows estimation of species-specific responses to environmental covariates, which will increase our ability to link species-level effects to metacommunity-wide patterns. After reviewing the EMS framework, we introduce a simple multispecies occupancy model and show how DECEMS can work in practice, highlighting that detection error often causes EMS to assign incorrect structures. To emphasize the broader applicability of this approach, we further illustrate that DECEMS can reduce the rate of structure misclassification by more than 20{\%} in some cases, even proving useful when detection error rates are quite low (;10{\%}). Integrating occupancy models and the EMS framework will lead to more accurate descriptions of metacommunity structure and to a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which different structures arise.},

abstract = {The purpose of this analysis is to provide information useful for designing effective maternal and child health interventions to improve infant survival in Guinea. While the final reports of the Guinea Demographic and Health Surveys (GDHS) 2005 and 2012 provide valuable descriptive information on levels and trends of early childhood mortality and on the use of maternal and child health (MCH) services, the present analysis goes a step beyond, to further investigate the relationship between specific MCH interventions and infant survival.   This survival analysis showed that improvements in infant survival occurred mainly in the later months of the first year of life. The results suggest that delivery in a health facility and postnatal care for the newborn, along with other unidentified factors, are most likely to affect survival outcomes. The latter is particularly true for neonatal survival, since we did not find evidence that the MCH indicators tested in this study are associated with better neonatal survival.},

@article{Kirschbaum2013,
abstract = {Land-use change between forestry and agriculture can cause large net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), and the respective land uses associated with forest and pasture lead to different on-going emission rates of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and different surface albedo. Here, we quantify the overall net radiative forcing and consequent temperature change from specified land-use changes.These different radiative agents cause radiative forcing of different magnitudes and with different time profiles. Carbon emission can be very high when forests are cleared. Upon reforestation, the former carbon stocks can be regained, but the rate of carbon sequestration is much slower than the rate of carbon loss from deforestation. A production forest may undergo repeated harvest and regrowth cycles, each involving periods of C emission and release.Agricultural land, especially grazed pastures, have much higher N2O emissions than forests because of their generally higher nitrogen status that can be further enhanced through intensification of the nitrogen cycle by animal excreta. Because of its longevity in the atmosphere, N2O concentrations build up nearly linearly over many decades. CH4 emissions can be very high from ruminant animals grazing on pastures. Because of its short atmospheric longevity, the CH4 concentration from a converted pasture accumulates for only a few decades before reaching a new equilibrium when emission of newly produced CH4 is balanced by the oxidation of previously emitted CH4. Albedo changes generally have the opposite radiative forcing from those of the GHGs and partly negate their radiative forcing. Overall and averaged over 100years, CO2 is typically responsible for 50{\%} of radiative forcing and CH4 and N2O for 25{\%} each. Albedo changes can negate the radiative forcing by the three greenhouse gases by 20-25{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature B.V. Food and nutrition insecurity remains a challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Several studies have examined food and nutrition insecurity in urban or rural areas but have not captured the whole continuum. Between November and December 2013, 240 households were surveyed along the urban–rural continuum in Northern Ghana. The study objective was to understand the socio-spatial dynamics of household food and nutrition insecurity and to investigate the role played by urban, peri-urban and rural agriculture. The study found that there was more involvement in agriculture in rural areas compared to peri-urban areas and urban areas. Households from urban areas were more food insecure (HFIAS {\textgreater} 11) compared to their counterparts in peri-urban and the rural areas. Stunting increased by 3.4 times (p = 0.048) among households located in the peri-urban area. Wasting was reduced by 0.16 times among household that produced staple food or vegetables (p = 0.011). Overweight was reduced by 0.04 times among households that produced livestock (p = 0.031). The results reveal a socio-spatial dimension of food and nutrition insecurity that is related to agricultural activities.},

Environmental income shares are higher for low-income households, but differences across income quintiles are less pronounced than previously thought. The poor rely more heavily on subsistence products such as wood fuels and wild foods, and on products harvested from natural areas other than forests. In absolute terms environmental income is approximately five times higher in the highest income quintile, compared to the two lowest quintiles.},

We argue that the simplicity achieved is gained at a cost; dichotomization may create rather than avoid problems, notably a considerable loss of power and residual confounding. In addition, the use of a data-derived 'optimal' cutpoint leads to serious bias. We illustrate the impact of dichotomization of continuous predictor variables using as a detailed case study a randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis. Dichotomization of continuous data is unnecessary for statistical analysis and in particular should not be applied to explanatory variables in regression models.},

abstract = {Aim  To test whether it is possible to establish a common biogeographical regionalization for plants and vertebrates in sub-Saharan Africa (the Afrotropical Region), using objective multivariate methods. Location  Sub-Saharan Africa (Afrotropical Region). Methods  We used 1° grid cell resolution databases for birds, mammals, amphibians and snakes (4142 vertebrate species) and c. 13{\%} of the plants (5881 species) from the Afrotropical Region. These databases were analysed using cluster analysis techniques to define biogeographical regions. A $\beta$(sim) dissimilarity matrix was subjected to a hierarchical classification using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA). The five group-specific biogeographical regionalizations were compared against a regionalization developed from a combined database, and a regionalization that is maximally congruent with the five group-specific datasets was determined using a consensus classification. The regionalizations were interpreted against measures of spatial turnover in richness and composition for the five datasets as well as the combined dataset. Results  We demonstrate the existence of seven well-defined and consistent biogeographical regions in sub-Saharan Africa. These regionalizations are statistically defined and robust between groups, with minor taxon-specific biogeographical variation. The proposed biogeographical regions are: Congolian, Zambezian, Southern African, Sudanian, Somalian, Ethiopian and Saharan. East Africa, the West African coast, and the transitions between the Congolian, Sudanian and Zambezian regions are unassigned. The Cape area in South Africa, Afromontane areas and the coastal region of East Africa do not emerge as distinct regions but are characterized by high neighbourhood heterogeneity, rapid turnover of species and high levels of narrow endemism. Main conclusions  Species distribution data and modern cluster analysis techniques can be used to define biogeographical regions in Africa that reflect the patterns found in both vertebrates and plants. The consensus of the regionalizations between different taxonomic groups is high. These regions are broadly similar to those proposed using expert opinion approaches. Some previously proposed transitional zones are not recognized in this classification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous analyses have shown the individual correlations between poverty, health and satellite-derived vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, generally these analyses did not explore the statistical interconnections between poverty, health outcomes and NDVI. METHODS: In this research aspatial methods (principal component analysis) and spatial models (variography, factorial kriging and cokriging) were applied to investigate the correlations and spatial relationships between intensity of poverty, health (expressed as child mortality and undernutrition), and NDVI for a large area of West Africa. RESULTS: This research showed that the intensity of poverty (and hence child mortality and nutrition) varies inversely with NDVI. From the spatial point-of-view, similarities in the spatial variation of intensity of poverty and NDVI were found. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the utility of satellite-based metrics for poverty models including health and ecological components and, in general for large scale analysis, estimation and optimisation of multidimensional poverty metrics. However, it also stresses the need for further studies on the causes of the association between NDVI, health and poverty. Once these relationships are confirmed and better understood, the presence of this ecological component in poverty metrics has the potential to facilitate the analysis of the impacts of climate change on the rural populations afflicted by poverty and child mortality.},

Further, rapid increases in the unemployment rate increased men's controlling behavior toward romantic partners even after we adjust for unemployment and economic distress at the household level.

Historical changes in land cover and land use were analyzed using a chronological series of remote sensing data.

The study reveals that the complex mosaics of agriculture and forest patches observed in the study area have long constituted key assets for the resilience of local livelihood systems in the face of environmental and socio-economic risks. However, over the past 20 years, a process of segregating agricultural and forest spaces has increased the vulnerability of local land users. This process is a direct outcome of policies aimed at increasing national forest cover, eradicating shifting cultivation and fostering the emergence of more intensive and commercial agricultural practices. We argue that agriculture-forest segregation should be buffered in such a way that a diversity of livelihood opportunities and economic development pathways can be maintained.},

abstract = {During the rainy season in 2007, reports about exceptional rains and floodings in the Sahel were published in the media, especially in August and September. Institutions and organizations like the World Food Programme (WFP) and FEWS NET put the events on the agenda and released alerts and requested help. The partly controversial picture was that most of the Sahel faced a crisis caused by widespread floodings. Our study shows that the rainy season in 2007 was exceptional with regard to rainfall amount and return periods. In many areas the event had a return period between 1 and 50 yr with high spatial heterogeneity, with the exception of the Upper Volta basin, which yielded return periods of up to 1200 yr. Despite the strong rainfall, the interpretation of satellite images show that the floods were mainly confined to lakes and river beds. However, the study also proves the difficulties in assessing the meteorological processes and the demarcation of flooded areas in satellite images without ground truthing. These facts and the somewhat vague and controversial reports in the media and FEWS NET demonstrate that it is crucial to thoroughly analyze such events at a regional and local scale involving the local population. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).

abstract = {Accessing family planning can reduce a significant proportion of maternal, infant, and childhood deaths. In Ethiopia, use of modern contraceptive met hods is low but is increasing. This study aimed to analyze the levels, trends, and determinants of modern contraceptive use and changes over time among young married women in Ethiopia.  The study used data from the three Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in Ethiopia, in 2000, 2005, and 2011. Non-pregnant, young married women age 15-24 were included in the final samples, for sample sizes of 2,157 in 2000, 1,904 in 2005, and 2,146 in 2011. The major statistical techniques used were logistic regression for analysis of determinants of current contraceptive use and logit-based decomposition analysis of factors contributing to the recent changes. STATA 12 was employed for data management and analyses. All calculations presented in this paper were weighted for the sampling probabilities and non-response. Complex sampling procedures were also considered during testing of statistical significance.  Among young married women, modern contraceptive prevalence increased from 6{\%} in 2000 to 16{\%} in 2005 and to 36{\%} in 2011. The study found that young women?s wealth status, age, religion, education, family size concordance with husbands, and fertility preference for spacing or limiting births were significantly associated with their use of modern contraception. The decomposition analysis indicated that about a third of the overall change in modern contraceptive use was due to difference in women?s characteristics. For this component, changes in women?s age, educational status, religion, family size concordance, and fertility preference were significantly associated with change in modern contraceptive use. Particularly, an increase in women?s attainment of primary and above education accounted for about a tenth of the change in modern contraceptive use over the study period.  About two-thirds of the increase in contraceptive use was due to difference in coefficients. Change in contraceptive use behavior among the rural population and among Orthodox Christians and Protestants showed a significant contribution to the increase. Other things being constant, about a third of the increase in modern contraceptive use in the past decade was due to change in contraceptive use behavior among the rural population.  Programmatic  interventions  targeting poor, younger (adolescent), illiterate, and Muslim women would help to maintain the increasing trend in contraceptive use among young women in Ethiopia.},

abstract = {Cotton yields in Mali have fallen during the past 15 years while maize yields have risen. The objective of this study is to examine key changes in the agricultural system to understand how these changes might have influenced the production of these key crops. In particular, this study seeks to understand the causes of the drop in cotton yields in southern Mali and to question the hypotheses that rapid extensification of agriculture or soil fertility loss caused the decline. The study puts forth an alternative hypothesis that fertilizer shifting - whereby farmers apply fertilizers designated for cotton to grain crops - was an important and under-recognized factor in the decline in cotton and simultaneous rise in grain yields.The study uses a mixed method approach which combines satellite image analysis with a household survey from the main cotton growing region in Mali and in-depth interviews with farmers for two key cotton growing areas to determine the causes of agricultural change.The study uses satellite image analysis to document agricultural expansion and intensification over a 35 year period (1975-2010). It uses a household survey from nine villages in three cotton growing areas to document changes in the agricultural system and in production and yields for key crops including maize, cotton and other grains. It uses in-depth interviews with farmers from 15 villages in two cotton growing areas to study farmer decision-making in terms of farming inputs for crops.The image analysis finds no evidence of rapid expansion of agriculture during the period of interest. These findings are supported by those from a household-level farm survey which finds that the major change in the agricultural system has been the increase in the area of intensively farmed crops along with a significant rise in maize yields. Finally, in-depth interviews with farmers growing cotton and maize find that the constraints on accessing fertilizer are a major determinant of farmer decision making.We conclude that the past 15 years of agricultural change in southern Mali can best be described as one where agriculture expanded slowly with gradual intensification of grain farming centered on maize production and simultaneous disintensification of cotton production as farmers shifted resources from cotton to maize resulting in a decline in cotton yields.},

abstract = {Swidden agriculture is by far the dominant land use system in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia (SEA). It provides various valuable subsistence products to local farmers, mostly the poor ethnic minority groups. Controversially, it is also closely connected with a number of environmental issues. With the strengthening regional economic cooperation in SEA, swidden agriculture has experienced drastic transformations into other diverse market-oriented land use types since the 1990s. However, there is very limited information on the basic geographical and demographic data of swidden agriculture and the socio-economic and biophysical effects of the transformations. International programs, such as the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD), underscore the importance of monitoring and evaluating swidden agriculture and its transition to reduce carbon emission due to deforestation and forest degradation. In this context, along with the accessibility of Landsat historical imagery, remote sensing based techniques will offer an effective way to detect and monitor the locations and extent of swidden agriculture. Many approaches for investigating fire occurrence and burned area can be introduced for swidden agriculture mapping due to the common feature of fire relatedness. In this review paper, four broad approaches involving spectral signatures, phenological characteristics, statistical theory and landscape ecology were summarized for swidden agriculture delineation. Five research priorities about swidden agriculture involving remote sensing techniques, spatial pattern, change, drivers and impacts were proposed accordingly. To our knowledge, a synthesis review on the remote sensing and outlook on swidden agriculture has not been reported yet. This review paper aims to give a comprehensive overview of swidden agriculture studies in the domains of debated definition, trends, remote sensing methods and outlook research in SEA undertaken in the past two decades.},

Our starting point is the striking regional trends in the length of birth intervals as observed in the five Tanzanian surveys of the Demographic and Health Surveys Program that have been conducted in the country from 1991 to 2010. In particular this study focuses mainly on the populations of Western and Southern Zones, where the DHS also showed contrasts in the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) for modern methods over time. In the Western Zone, the CPR was 2{\%} in 1991, and then 7{\%} for the next three surveys, eventually rising to 13{\%} in the 2010 survey. In the Southern Zone, the CPR was 4{\%} in 1991 and rose substantially in each survey until it reached 36{\%} in 2010. These two zones present stark contrasts in both the duration of birth intervals and in the use of contraception.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT. The ability of agroecosystems to provide food ultimately depends on the regulating and supporting ecosystem services that underpin their functioning, such as the regulation of soil quality, water quality, soil erosion, pests, and pollinators. However, there are trade-offs between provisioning and regulating or supporting services, whose nature at the farm and plot scales is poorly understood. We analyzed data at the farm level for two agroecosystems with contrasting objectives in central Mexico: one aimed at staple crop production for self-subsistence and local markets, the other directed to a cash crop for export markets. Bivariate and multivariate trade- offs were analyzed for different crop management strategies (conventional, organic, traditional, crop rotation) and their underpinning socioeconomic drivers. There was a clear trade-off between crop yield and soil quality in self-subsistence systems. However, other expected trade-offs between yields and soil quality did not always occur, likely because of the overall good soils of the region and the low to medium input profile of most farms. Trade-offs were highly dependent on farm-specific agricultural practices; organic, traditional, and rotation management systems generally showed smaller trade-offs between yield and soil quality, pest control, and biodiversity than did conventional management systems. Perceived drivers reported by farmers included increasing prices for cash crops, rising costs of inputs, and extreme climatic events (e.g., drought, hail, frost). Farmers did not identify the regulation of soil quality, water quality, soil erosion, pests, or pollinators as important constraints. Although acceptable yields could be maintained irrespective of key regulating and supporting services according to these perceptions, current levels of soil erosion and nutrient runoff are likely to have important negative effects at the watershed scale. Sustainability in both agroecosystems could be increased substantially by promoting alternative practices},

The relationships of variability in rainfall and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) to malaria incidence are assessed at the national level after removing the impact of non-climatic trends and a major policy intervention. Variability in rainfall totals for the period December-February accounts for more than two-thirds of the inter-annual variability in standardized malaria incidence in Botswana (January-May). Both rainfall and annual malaria anomalies in December-February are significantly related to SSTs in the eastern Pacific, suggesting they may be predictable months in advance using seasonal climate forecasting methodologies.},

It finds these shifts to be consistent with post-modern thinking in other spheres, and it draws on the wider debate to recommend food security policy which eschews meta-narratives in favour of recognizing diversity, providing households and individuals with choices which contribute to self-determination and autonomy.

We focus on child health and offer the first spatially explicit analysis of the interaction between water source and food insecurity on children's health in Burkina Faso, an African nation that continues to struggle with poor children's health. We combine data from the 2010 Demographic and Health Survey, a small USAID water quality survey collected from community wells, and remotely sensed imagery. Results suggest that, in a few cases, reliable and clean water sources are positively correlated to children's linear growth and weight gain, although in many regions, the interaction with community-level food production is critical to understanding health outcomes. The results also suggest that maternal health and nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding are foundational to the healthy development of young children. In all, the findings provide evidence of the importance of multi-sectoral interventions targeted at improving children's health.},

This paper reviews key examples to understand the superior effect of nature based solutions to enhance the sustainability of catchment systems by promoting desirable soil and landscape functions. The use of concepts such as connectivity and the theory of system thinking framework allowed to review coastal and river management as a guide to evaluate other strategies to achieve sustainability. In land management NBSs are not mainstream management. Through a set of case studies: organic farming in Spain; rewilding in Slovenia; land restoration in Iceland, sediment trapping in Ethiopia and wetland construction in Sweden, we show the potential of Nature based solutions (NBSs) as a cost-effective long term solution for hydrological risks and land degradation. NBSs can be divided into two main groups of strategies: soil solutions and landscape solutions. Soil solutions aim to enhance the soil health and soil functions through which local eco-system services will be maintained or restored. Landscape solutions mainly focus on the concept of connectivity. Making the landscape less connected, facilitating less rainfall to be transformed into runoff and therefore reducing flood risk, increasing soil moisture and reducing droughts and soil erosion we can achieve the sustainability. The enhanced eco-system services directly feed into the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.},

abstract = {An important question for policy is the extent to which catch-up growth can ease the impact of early stunting. Martorell et al. (1992) showed that stunted Guatemalan infants remain stunted into adulthood, whereas Adair (1999) found appreciable catch-up growth in Filipino children from 2-12 years. Both groups defined catch-up as an inverse correlation between early height and subsequent growth, but Martorell based the correlation on height, whereas Adair used height z scores. The statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean is much like catch-up growth, an inverse correlation between initial height and later height gain. The objective of this study was to reexamine the relationship between stunting and later catch-up growth in the context of regression to the mean. The design was a theoretical analysis showing that catch-up growth is more evident based on height z scores than on height, validated using data on 495 stunted South African children seen at 2 and 5 years of age. The correlation between height at 2 and height change from 2 to 5 was small based on height (-0.11) but large and highly significant based on height z score (-0.58), providing strong evidence of catch-up growth. We argue that catch-up growth should be estimated using height z score not height and that catch-up is present only when the change in z score exceeds that predicted by regression to the mean. This leads to a compact definition of catch-up growth: if z1 and z2 are the initial and final (mean) height z scores, and r is the correlation between them, then catch-up growth for groups or individuals is given by (z2 - rz1).},

The 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) reports that approximately a quarter of all pregnant young women age 15-24 feel that th eir pregnancies are mistimed or unwanted. Studies show that complications related to pregnancy and childbirth are among the leading causes of death worldwide for adolescent girls age 15-19. In Ethiopia, where early marriage and early sexual activity in marriage are prevalent, family planning gives couples the ability to limit the number and spacing of their children, potentially lowering the death rate for women in this age group.},

abstract = {Objectives: The main objective of this study is to analyze the trends in obesity among Jordanian women of reproductive age over the 10-year period from 2002 to 2012 based on three Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Furthermore, the study aims to analyze the possible factors predicting obesity among Jordanian women.    Methodology: The individual and household member data sets for each survey provided data for ever-married and unmarried women, respectively. The body mass index (BMI) of each woman was calculated by dividing her weight in kilograms by the square of her height in meters. A binary variable identifying women with BMI of 30 kg/m2 and above as obese was used throughout for descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses. Two sets of analyses were performed, one for all women and the other for ever- married women only. Each set of analyses covers the three DHS surveys, which were conducted in 2002, 2009 and 2012. For multivariate analysis, in addition to three models of standard logistic regression for individual surveys, we used a multi-level fixed effect model for the pooled data. Independent variables included age, education, place of residence, wealth quintiles and marital status. For the ever-married sample additional variables related to parity, use of contraceptive method, smoking and working status were used. We used STATA version 12 to consolidate the data sets and the survey data analysis module in STATA to perform descriptive and multivariate analyses.  Results: No major differences in mean BMI or the prevalence of obesity were observed among women of reproductive age across the three examined surveys. The mean BMI of the all-women sample was approximately 27 kg/m2 for the three surveys, while in the ever-married sample it went was slightly higher, at 29 kg/m2. The prevalence of obesity for all women ranged from 26.3 percent in 2002 to 28.7 percent in 2012. In the ever-married women sample, the lowest prevalence of obesity occurred in 2002, at 37.4 percent, and the highest in 2009, at 38.9 percent. The prevalence of obesity ranged across the surveys from 8 percent to 13 percent for never-married women and from 37 percent to 39 percent for ever-married women. Even after adjustment for the age differences between these groups, the never-married were less likely to be obese than the ever-married.},

Given these outcomes, we hypothesized that the determinants of food security and nutritional status in rural and urban areas of Mozambique would differ as well. Yet we find that the determinants of food insecurity and malnutrition, and the magnitudes of their effects, are very nearly the same, although some differentiation in determinants of undernutrition does begin to appear among children 24-60 months old. The difference in observed outcomes appears primarily due to differences in the levels of critical determinants rather than in the nature of the determinants themselves.},

abstract = {For decades, the dynamics of tropical deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have defied easy explanation. The rates of deforestation have been lower than elsewhere in the tropics, and the driving forces evident in other places, government newland settlement schemes and industrialized agriculture, have largely been absent in SSA. The context and causes for African deforestation become clearer through an analysis of new, national-level data on forest cover change for SSA countries for the 2000-2005 period. The recent dynamic in SSA varies from dry to wet biomes. Deforestation occurred at faster rates in nations with predominantly dry forests. The wetter Congo basin countries had lower rates of deforestation, in part because tax receipts from oil and mineral industries in this region spurred rural to urban migration, declines in agriculture and increased imports of cereals from abroad. In this respect, the Congo basin countries may be experiencing an oil and mineral fuelled forest transition. Small farmers play a more important role in African deforestation than they do in southeast Asia and Latin America, in part because small-scale agriculture remains one of the few livelihoods open to rural peoples. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling. This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity.},

abstract = {Background: Obesity and its co-occurrence with household food insecurity among low-income families is a public health concern, particularly because both are associated with later adverse health consequences. Objective: Our aim was to examine the relationship between household food insecurity with and without hunger in infancy and later childhood with weight status at 2 to 5 years. Design: This longitudinal study uses household food-security status, weight, and height data collected at the first infancy and last child (2 to 5 years) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children visits. Household food security was based on parent/caretaker responses to a four-question subscale of the 18-item Core Food Security Module. Obesity was defined as sex-specific body mass index for age ≥95th percentile. Participants/setting: A diverse (58.6{\%} non-white) low-income sample of 28,353 children participating in the Massachusetts Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (2001-2006); 24.9{\%} of infants and 23.1{\%} of children lived in food-insecure households and 17.1{\%} were obese at their last child visit. Statistical analysis: Multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed the association between household food-security status during the infant and child visits, and risk of preschool obesity, while controlling for child race/Hispanic ethnicity, sex, child and household size, maternal age, education, and prepregnancy weight. Interactions between these covariates and household food-security status were also examined. In cases of multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction was applied. Results: Persistent household food insecurity without hunger was associated with 22{\%} greater odds of child obesity (odds ratio=1.22; 95{\%} CI 1.06 to 1.41) compared with those persistently food secure (P{\textless}0.05). Maternal prepregnancy weight status modified this association with children of underweight (adjusted odds ratio=3.22; 95{\%} CI 1.70 to 6.11; P=0.003) or overweight/obese (adjusted odds ratio=1.34; 95{\%} CI 1.11 to 1.62; P=0.03) mothers experiencing greater odds of child obesity with persistent household food insecurity without hunger compared with those with persistent household food security. Conclusions: These results suggest that persistent household food insecurity without hunger is prospectively related to child obesity, but that these associations depend on maternal weight status. Vulnerable groups should be targeted for early interventions to prevent overweight and obesity later in life. {\textcopyright} 2012 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.},

abstract = {Air pollution exposure studies in the past decade have focused on acute (days) or long-term (years) effects. We present an analysis of medium-term (weeks to months) exposure effects of particulate pollution and temperature. We assessed the associations of particulate pollution (black smoke) and temperature with age-standardized daily mortality rates over 17 years in Dublin, Ireland, using a polynomial distributed lag model of both temperature and particulate air pollution simultaneously through 40 days after exposure. When only acute effects (3-day mean) were considered, we found total mortality increased by 0.4{\%} for each 10-$\mu$g/m 3 increase in black smoke concentration. When deaths in the 40 days after exposure were considered, we found a 1.1{\%} increase. For respiratory mortality, the estimated effect was 0.9{\%} for acute exposures, but 3.6{\%} for the extended follow-up. We found each increase in current-day temperature by 1 °C was associated with a 0.4{\%} increase in total mortality, whereas each decrease of 1 °C was associated with a 2.6{\%} increase in mortality in the following 40 days. For both temperature and pollution, the largest effects on cardiovascular mortality were observed immediately, whereas respiratory mortality was delayed and distributed over several weeks. These effects were two to three times greater than the acute effects reported in other studies, and approach the effects reported in longer-term survival studies. This analysis suggests that studies on the acute effects of air pollution have underestimated the total effects of temperature and particulate air pollution on mortality.},

abstract = {The combination of a rising population and increased food demand has placed tremendous pressure on the land resources of Bangladesh. These pressures are exacerbated by the annual wet-season ¯oods which frequently devastate much of the agricultural land. Successive governments have therefore sought international aid to assist in the development of ¯ood control measures. Of particular importance are 14 major schemes which aim to provide protection from 20±25 year return ¯oods by the construction of earth-embanked enclosures. There is no doubt that these schemes have been very successful in protecting valuable agricultural areas from ¯oods and hence increasing agricultural production. There is, however, growing evidence from a range of sources for long-term deterioration in soil fertility within the project areas. The study reported here is the {\textregistered}rst to systematically examine the changes taking place in soil properties following the establishment of a ¯ood control, drainage and irrigation project. Comparison of two soil series, sampled from within and without the project area, demonstrate that within six years of project establishment, signi{\textregistered}cant adverse changes have occurred in several soil properties; these include increasing acidity and a decline in available nutrients. The changes are attributable to a combination of poor management strategies and the absence of the annual ¯ood input of silt. As Bangladesh cannot aord any decline in agricultural output, it is vital to establish whether adverse changes recorded here are occurring in other projects. This can be achieved by the establishment of a nationwide programme of soil fertility monitoring.},

abstract = {Almost every ecosystem has been amended so that plants and animals can be used as food, fibre, fodder, medicines, traps and weapons. Historically, wild plants and animals were sole dietary components for hunter-gatherer and forager cultures. Today, they remain key to many agricultural communities. The mean use of wild foods by agricultural and forager communities in 22 countries of Asia and Africa (36 studies) is 90-100 species per location. Aggregate country estimates can reach 300-800 species (e.g. India, Ethiopia, Kenya). The mean use of wild species is 120 per community for indigenous communities in both industrialized and developing countries. Many of these wild foods are actively managed, suggesting there is a false dichotomy around ideas of the agricultural and the wild: hunter-gatherers and foragers farm and manage their environments, and cultivators use many wild plants and animals. Yet, provision of and access to these sources of food may be declining as natural habitats come under increasing pressure from development, conservation-exclusions and agricultural expansion. Despite their value, wild foods are excluded from official statistics on economic values of natural resources. It is clear that wild plants and animals continue to form a significant proportion of the global food basket, and while a variety of social and ecological drivers are acting to reduce wild food use, their importance may be set to grow as pressures on agricultural productivity increase.},

abstract = {Respiratory illness and diarrhea are the two most important causes of death in children under the age of 5 in the Philippines. The government has accorded high priority to reducing the number of deaths caused by these illnesses as it attempts to reform its healthcare system. In order to re-design health systems, policy makers need to have a good understanding not only of overall health services utilization, but also of the use of public and private sectors. We used the 1998 Philippines National Demographic and Health Survey dataset to understand the service utilization patterns of children under 5 with diarrhea and/or respiratory illness. Using the Andersen Model as the conceptual framework, a nested logit regression approach was used to determine predictors of health services use, and of public vs. private use in this population. Our results indicate that maternal education and number of illnesses determine the decision to seek care. Once the decision has been made to seek care, the choice between a public or private provider is affected by the family's economic status and size of the household. Policy makers can use such information for future health planning and reform, in order to increase access to healthcare for this vulnerable population in the Philippines.},

The world is rapidly shifting from a dietary period in which the higher-income countries are dominated by patterns of degenerative diseases (whereas the lower- and middle-income countries are dominated by receding famine) to one in which the world is increasingly being dominated by degenerative diseases. This article documents the high levels of overweight and obesity found across higher- and lower-income countries and the global shift of this burden toward the poor and toward urban and rural populations. Dietary changes appear to be shifting universally toward a diet dominated by higher intakes of animal and partially hydrogenated fats and lower intakes of fiber. Activity patterns at work, at leisure, during travel, and in the home are equally shifting rapidly toward reduced energy expenditure. Large-scale decreases in food prices (eg, beef prices) have increased access to supermarkets, and the urbanization of both urban and rural areas is a key underlying factor. Limited documentation of the extent of the increased effects of the fast food and bottled soft drink industries on this nutrition shift is available, but some examples of the heterogeneity of the underlying changes are presented. The challenge to global health is clear.},

abstract = {Fires are critical elements in the Earth System, linking climate, humans, and vegetation. With 200-500 Mha burnt annually, fire disturbs a greater area over a wider variety of biomes than any other natural disturbance. Fire ignition, propagation, and impacts depend on the interactions among climate, vegetation structure, and land use on local to regional scales. Therefore, fires and their effects on terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to global change. Fires can cause dramatic changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. They have significant impacts on the atmosphere and biogeochemical cycles. By contributing significantly to greenhouse gas (e.g., with the release of 1.7-4.1 Pg of carbon per year) and aerosol emissions, and modifying surface properties, they affect not only vegetation but also climate. Fires also modify the provision of a variety of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, soil fertility, grazing value, biodiversity, and tourism, and can hence trigger land use change. Fires must therefore be included in global and regional assessments of vulnerability to global change. Fundamental understanding of vulnerability of land systems to fire is required to advise management and policy. Assessing regional vulnerabilities resulting from biophysical and human consequences of changed fire regimes under global change scenarios requires an integrated approach. Here we present a generic conceptual framework for such integrated, multidisciplinary studies. The framework is structured around three interacting (partially nested) subsystems whose dynamics contribute to vulnerability. The first subsystem describes the controls on fire regimes (exposure). A first feedback subsystem links fire regimes to atmospheric and climate dynamics within the Earth System (sensitivity), while the second feedback subsystem links changes in fire regimes to changes in the provision of ecological services and to their consequences for human systems (adaptability). We then briefly illustrate how the framework can be applied to two regional cases with contrasting ecological and human context: boreal forests of northern America and African savannahs.},

We propose an explanatory framework to enhance consideration of how these effects may operate and to encourage debate about this important aspect of the health impacts of climate change. METHODS Literature review. RESULTS Climate change may affect mental health directly by exposing people to trauma. It may also affect mental health indirectly, by affecting (1) physical health (for example, extreme heat exposure causes heat exhaustion in vulnerable people, and associated mental health consequences) and (2) community wellbeing. Within community, wellbeing is a sub-process in which climate change erodes physical environments which, in turn, damage social environments. Vulnerable people and places, especially in low-income countries, will be particularly badly affected. CONCLUSIONS Different aspects of climate change may affect mental health through direct and indirect pathways, leading to serious mental health problems, possibly including increased suicide mortality. We propose that it is helpful to integrate these pathways in an explanatory framework, which may assist in developing public health policy, practice and research.},

This study examines unmet need in Uganda from 1995 to 2006 using data from three of the Demographic and Heath Surveys. The study provides levels, trends, and differentials for unmet need; the factors associated with unmet need; reasons for contraceptive nonuse; and the likely impact of reducing unmet need. The results show that unmet need is highest among currently married women, women in rural areas, and women in the Northern region. Unmet need is increasing among currently married women, all sexually active women, and never-married sexually active women. Unmet need for spacing is more prevalent than for limiting. Women with an unmet need for spacing are more likely to lack employment, live in the Northern region, and not receive family planning messages in the media while women with an unmet need for limiting, in contrast, tend to be older and live in rural areas. Total unmet need is associated with higher parity and living in the Northern region. Substantial proportions of women do not use, and do not intend to use, contraception in the future due to the fear of side effects and opposition from the husband or partner. Based on statistical models, modest declines in unmet need and increases in contraceptive prevalence in Uganda can substantially reduce the country?s total fertility rate. },

An analysis of the context of women?s health explores the status of maternal health (since most women age 15-49 years are mothers in developing countries, key measures of women?s health are based on mothers) along with the social, behavioral, and environmental contexts that encompass the lives of women.  For this report, the status of women?s health is measured by the maternal mortality ratio, maternal nutritional status, and proportion of low birth weight babies born to women. Social context indicators include education, employment, marital status, and household headship experiences of women that influence women?s potential access to resources and information. The behavioral context of women?s health is composed of the decisions and actions that influence overall fertility, such as a woman?s age at first intercourse and first marriage, fertility-limiting behaviors, use of antenatal and delivery services, and awareness of preventive HIV/AIDS practices. The environmental context describes the external living conditions of women, including housing quality, amenities, access to water, and sanitation. The paper concludes that while behavior change policies and programs focusing on the individual are important to improve the health of women, efforts at the social and environmental levels are also needed to effect improvements in women?s health. },

abstract = {A common challenge in analyzing urbanization is the data. The United Nations compiles information on urbanization (urban population and its share of total national population) that is reported by various countries but there is no standardized definition of urban, resulting in inconsistencies. This situation is particularly troublesome if one wishes to conduct a cross- country analysis or determine the aggregate urbanization status of the regions (such as Asia or Latin America) and the world. This paper proposes an alternative measure of urban concentration that we call an agglomeration index. It is based on three factors: population density, the population of a large urban center, and travel time to that large urban center. The main objective in constructing this new measure is to provide a globally consistent definition of settlement concentration to conduct cross-country comparative and aggregated analyses in the same way that the {\$}1 per day poverty line is used in poverty issues-related studies. As an accessible measure of economic density, the agglomeration index lends itself to the study of concepts such as agglomeration rents in urban areas, the thickness of a market, and the travel distance to such a market with many workers and consumers. With anticipated advances in remote sensing technology and geo-coded data analysis tools, the agglomeration index can be further refined to address some of the caveats currently associated with it.},

In both areas, expansion of cotton farming, considered as one of the most polluting forms of agriculture in the world, drives major land use change and loss of biodiversity. In both areas, various forms of conservation agriculture have been developed and tested. We highlight the potential benefit of conservation agriculture in controlling negative environmental effects traditionally associated with agriculture and reducing the need for land conversion through increased biophysical resource use efficiency, turning agriculture from a threat to an opportunity for conservation. Finally, we raise a number of issues that constitute challenges for the widespread adoption of these technologies by resource-poor farmers, and formulate recommendations for the development, evaluation and diffusion of conservation agriculture technologies for smallholders in semi-arid Africa.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, The Author(s). Agriculture and food are assumed to be critical determinants of stunting and micronutrient deficiency. However, agriculture research for development has not translated as expected into better nutrition outcomes. We argue that to do so, agriculture research needs to be fundamentally changed, from the current emphasis on supply-side production and productivity goals to understanding consumption and addressing factors that can improve diet quality. Some of the research will be to improve the efficiency of supply for more nutritious foods. Other research will need to focus on factors that promote diet quality rather than focus on food security goals through stocks of staple cereals. Because of its importance in low-income, high-burden countries, agriculture can also contribute more effectively to multisectoral nutrition-sensitive development strategies and programs. Critical roles for agricultural research in multisectoral actions will be better metrics, indicators and research studies for diet quality and better evaluation methods – both randomized trials for specific interventions and contribution analysis through theories of change for more complex multisectoral system interventions to prevent stunting  and micronutrient deficiencies. To achieve improvements in nutrition outcomes at scale, researchers must engage in new partnerships. In food systems, these partnerships must include more disciplines from agriculture and food science through economics and social science to business and delivery science. Food system researchers will also need to engage more with value chain actors and policy makers. Current efforts to improve nutrition outcomes at scale are severely hampered by data and evidence gaps that prevent better decisions and faster learning.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the association between weather shocks (droughts and floods) and agricultural market performance in Mozambique. To do so, we employ a dyadic regression analysis on monthly maize prices, transport costs, and spatial identification of markets as well as droughts and flooded areas. Our estimates show that, while a drought reduces price differences between markets, price dispersion increases during flood periods, an effect that is mainly driven by increases in transport costs. Finally, floods are found to affect price differences more if markets are closer to each other and if the road infrastructure quality is poor. An important implication of our results is that markets show some degree of efficiency during supply shock periods in Mozambique. However, spatial market integration continues to be insufficient, probably due to high transfer costs.},

abstract = {This study identifies the severity of impacts of drought in 2012 on domestic water supply, crop production, unskilled rural employment, and financial status of rural households in a drought-prone area of India. It is based on secondary and primary data collected by interviewing 223 households. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential applications in SPSS. As a consequence of drought, access to domestic water supply was cumbersome and time spent on water collection activities almost doubled compared with the time required in years with normal rainfall. On average, a respondent household suffered a loss of about 86{\%} in production of major crops. High reductions in on-farm unskilled employment opportunities and an increase in unskilled labor in off-farm rural employment activities were reported. It was found that about 69{\%} of respondents were availing loans and 79{\%} of them delayed repayment of loans due to the consequences of drought. Our results indicated that the extent of drought damage varied according to household size, annual income, landholding size, farming system in use, and drought intensity. The effects of these factors on farming communities are reported with empirical evidence. Respondents with large family size, low to marginal land holding size, low income, and rainfed farming systems are found to be more vulnerable to drought impacts; special attention should be given towards increasing their resilience when designing drought management strategies.},

Three major factors influence the actions of the abused wives: The less severe and less frequent the violence, the more a wife remained with her husband. Secondly, the more a wife was struck as a child by her parents, the more likely she was to remain with her abusive husband. Finally, the fewer resources a wife had and the less power she had the more likely she was to stay with her violent husband. In addition, external constraint influenced the actions of abused wives.

abstract = {Malaria transmission is strongly determined by the environmental temperature and the environment is rarely constant. Therefore, mosquitoes and parasites are not only exposed to the mean temperature, but also to daily temperature variation. Recently, both theoretical and laboratory work has shown, in addition to mean temperatures, daily fluctuations in temperature can affect essential mosquito and parasite traits that determine malaria transmission intensity. However, so far there is no epidemiological evidence at the population level to this problem. Methods. Thirty counties in southwest China were selected, and corresponding weekly malaria cases and weekly meteorological variables were collected from 2004 to 2009. Particularly, maximum, mean and minimum temperatures were collected. The daily temperature fluctuation was measured by the diurnal temperature range (DTR), the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature. The distributed lag non-linear model (MDLNM) was used to study the correlation between weekly malaria incidences and weekly mean temperatures, and the correlation pattern was allowed to vary over different levels of daily temperature fluctuations. Results: The overall non-linear patterns for mean temperatures are distinct across different levels of DTR. When under cooler temperature conditions, the larger mean temperature effect on malaria incidences is found in the groups of higher DTR, suggesting that large daily temperature fluctuations act to speed up the malaria incidence in cooler environmental conditions. In contrast, high daily fluctuations under warmer conditions will lead to slow down the mean temperature effect. Furthermore, in the group of highest DTR, 24-25°C or 21-23°C are detected as the optimal temperature for the malaria transmission. Conclusion: The environment is rarely constant, and the result highlights the need to consider temperature fluctuations as well as mean temperatures, when trying to understand or predict malaria transmission. This work may be the first epidemiological study confirming that the effect of the mean temperature depends on temperature fluctuations, resulting in relevant evidence at the population level. {\textcopyright} 2014 Zhao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The challenge is to turn this recognition into incentives and institutions that will guide wise investments in natural capital, on a large scale. Advances are required on three key fronts, each featured here: the science of ecosystem production functions and service mapping; the design of appropriate finance, policy, and governance systems; and the art of implementing these in diverse biophysical and social contexts. Scientific understanding of ecosystem production functions is improving rapidly but remains a limiting factor in incorporating natural capital into decisions, via systems of national accounting and other mechanisms. Novel institutional structures are being established for a broad array of services and places, creating a need and opportunity for systematic assessment of their scope and limitations. Finally, it is clear that formal sharing of experience, and defining of priorities for future work, could greatly accelerate the rate of innovation and uptake of new approaches. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Background Detailed spatial understanding of levels and trends in under-5 mortality is needed to improve the targeting of interventions to the areas of highest need, and to understand the sources of variation in mortality. To improve this understanding, we analysed local-level information on child mortality across sub-Saharan Africa between 1980–2010. Methods We used data from 82 Demographic and Health Surveys in 28 sub-Saharan African countries, including the location and timing of 3{\textperiodcentered}24 million childbirths and 393 685 deaths, to develop high-resolution spatial maps of under-5 mortality in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. These estimates were at a resolution of 0{\textperiodcentered}1 degree latitude by 0{\textperiodcentered}1 degree longitude (roughly 10 km × 10 km). We then analysed this spatial information to distinguish within-country versus between-country sources of variation in mortality, to examine the extent to which declines in mortality have been accompanied by convergence in the distribution of mortality, and to study localised drivers of mortality differences, including temperature, malaria burden, and conflict. Findings In our sample of sub-Saharan African countries from the 1980s to the 2000s, within-country differences in under-5 mortality accounted for 74–78{\%} of overall variation in under-5 mortality across space and over time. Mortality differed significantly across only 8–15{\%} of country borders, supporting the role of local, rather than national, factors in driving mortality patterns. We found that by the end of the study period, 23{\%} of the eligible children in the study countries continue to live in mortality hotspots—areas where, if current trends continue, the Sustainable Developent Goals mortality targets will not be met. In multivariate analysis, within-country mortality levels at each pixel were significantly related to local temperature, malaria burden, and recent history of conflict. Interpretation Our findings suggest that sub-national determinants explain a greater portion of under-5 mortality than do country-level characteristics. Sub-national measures of child mortality could provide a more accurate, and potentially more actionable, portrayal of where and why children are still dying than can national statistics.

abstract = {Driven by political and economic reforms since 1990, the forestry sector in southeast European (SEE) countries has faced changes which have resulted, among others, in the rise of private businesses. Many of those businesses have demonstrated innovation in the sphere of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), although these products had been neglected in the past, and their potentials are still underestimated. Therefore, our aim was to get a better understanding of the innovation processes behind three case studies in selected SEE countries (Slovenia, Serbia and FYR Macedonia). For the purpose of this research, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with people responsible for the selected innovation cases in three NTFP-based enterprises. The interviews revolved around questions related to the idea and product development, the firm foundation, the supporting and hindering factors and the actors and their roles in the entire process of business development. To understand the framework conditions, we interviewed representatives of the organizations that were in charge of supporting innovation and business development. The results show that several national policy programs (e.g., in the fields of SMEs, forestry and nature protection) form a framework for supporting NTFPs innovation. However, in all the selected countries, there were no policies specifically tailored for NTFPs. An analysis showed that these innovations were developed solely by the owners and their personal ideas, and most information and financing came from the businesses themselves. The innovation systems in the selected countries did not significantly contribute to the development and running of the businesses. The lessons provided by these cases can be significant for strengthening existing NTFP-related innovation systems and fostering their effectiveness in the future.},

First, differentials in the coverage and utilization of maternity care are examined.  Next, the fertility-related factors that place women and their children at high risk are explored. Data on women who fall into high-risk categories are then used to calculate a new measure of unmet need for family planning with the goal of avoiding high-risk births.  The report concludes that the prevention of maternal mortality includes, in part, the prevention of high-risk pregnancies and a broadened definition of unmet need for family planning that considers known mortality risks associated with maternal age, parity, and birth spacing. },

abstract = {We developed a “continual engagement” model to better integrate knowledge from policy makers, communities, and researchers with the goal of promoting more effective action to balance poverty alleviation and wildlife conservation in 4 pastoral ecosystems of East Africa. The model involved the creation of a core boundary-spanning team, including community facilitators, a policy facilitator, and transdisciplinary researchers, responsible for linking with a wide range of actors from local to global scales. Collaborative researcher−facilitator community teams integrated local and scientific knowledge to help communities and policy makers improve herd quality and health, expand biodiversity payment schemes, develop land-use plans, and fully engage together in pastoral and wildlife policy development. This model focused on the creation of hybrid scientific−local knowledge highly relevant to community and policy maker needs. The facilitation team learned to be more effective by focusing on noncontroversial livelihood issues before addressing more difficult wildlife issues, using strategic and periodic engagement with most partners instead of continual engagement, and reducing costs by providing new scientific information only when deemed essential. We conclude by examining the role of facilitation in redressing asymmetries in power in researcher−community−policy maker teams, the role of individual values and character in establishing trust, and how to sustain knowledge-action links when project funding ends.},

abstract = {Ethiopia has a rapidly growing population. Currently, the population growth rate is 2.6 percent per annum. The population is expected to reach 80 million by 2009. The majority of the population resides in rural areas and is largely engaged in small-scale traditional farming that is highly dependent on rainfall. Rapid population growth can have negative consequences on the health care system, especially when the level of economic development of the country is low and when resources are scarce. The national reproductive health strategy sets specific targets for the provision of family planning services, where it has focused on reduction of unwanted pregnancies and enabling individuals to achieve their desired family size. The main targets set to measure the progress towards this goal include reaching a contraceptive coverage rate of 60{\%} by 2010 and ensuring awareness and increasing demand by 80{\%}. In 2000, only 8{\%} of currently married women were using contraception; in 2005, this level had increased to 14{\%}, but this is still far from programme targets. As of 2005, only 31{\%} of the family planning needs of currently married women had been met. Addressing the huge unmet need observed in the past decade is one area of critical intervention identified in the health sector development programme as well as in the reproductive health strategy of the country. However, it is important to understand the reasons for such high and persistent unmet need so that viable programme options can be formulated that will guide interventions at various levels.},

abstract = {The ubiquity and consequences of childhood growth stunting ({\textless}-2 SD in height-for-age Z score, HAZ) in rural areas of low-income nations has galvanized research into the reversibility of stunting, but the shortage of panel data has hindered progress. Using panel data from a native Amazonian society of foragers-farmers in Bolivia (Tsimane'), we estimate rates of catch-up growth for stunted children. One hundred forty-six girls and 158 boys 2 {\textless} or = age {\textless} or = 7 were measured annually during 2002-2006. Annual Delta height in cm and in HAZ were regressed separately against baseline stunting and control variables related to attributes of the child, mother, household, and village. Children stunted at baseline had catch-up growth rates 0.11 SD/year higher than their nonstunted age and sex peers, with a higher rate among children farther from towns. The rate of catch up did not differ by the child's sex. A 10{\%} rise in household income and an additional younger sibling lowered by 0.16 SD/year and 0.53 SD/year the rate of growth. Results were weaker when measuring Delta height in cm rather than in HAZ. Possible reasons for catch-up growth include (a) omitted variable bias, (b) parental reallocation of resources to redress growth faltering, particularly if parents perceive the benefits of redressing growth faltering for child school achievement, and (c) developmental plasticity during this period when growth rates are most rapid and linear growth trajectories have not yet canalized.},

The family planning program is among the government's planned goals and strategies for reducing poverty, developing the country and improving the health of the Rwandan population. This study presents levels, trends, and differentials in the use of contraception and estimates the level of unmet need for family planning among women of reproductive age. The use of contraception has increased substantially from 2000 to 2007-08 among women currently in union in Rwanda. From 2005 to 2007-08, contraceptive prevalence increased almost threefold from 13{\%} to 36{\%}. This increase is predominantly a result of an increase in the use of modern contraceptive methods. Women who are of prime reproductive age, have higher parity, are better educated, and live in urban and more highly developed areas (Kigali), are more likely than other women to use a contraceptive method. In 2007-08, the level of unmet need for family planning among women currently in union dropped, likely due to an increase in the use of contraception, particularly for the purpose of limiting births. In addition, the components of unmet need have changed as more women currently need family planning for limiting births than for spacing than in 2000 and 2005. },

abstract = {Bee diversity and pollination services delivery in coffee fields are known to be driven by micro, local, landscape and regional drivers. The purpose of this study was to provide empirical documentation of drivers of bee biodiversity and pollination services delivery to coffee (Coffea canephora) under local conditions in Uganda. On-farm pollination experiments were therefore conducted in 30 small-scale coffee farms with contrasting land-use and management characteristics. The results indicated that coffee flowers were visited by 24-38 bee species with meliponine bee species being the most frequent visitors. The highest fruit set (84{\%}) was recorded in hand cross-pollination followed by open pollination (62{\%}) and bagged flowers (0.8{\%}) treatment. Coffee proportion potential yield and bee contribution to fruit set were positively related to bee abundance, species richness, foraging rate and to the amount of semi-natural habitats available in the surroundings of coffee fields. Distance to forest/wetland and cultivation intensity were negatively related to coffee proportion potential yield but positively related to coffee pollination limitation. Farmers would benefit from establishing coffee fields in the vicinity of natural habitats and from adopting pollinator-friendly farming and conservation practices such as increasing the area of semi-natural habitat features as well as promoting high on-farm tree cover to protect good pollinators (e.g. meliponine bees) of coffee in the landscape. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

These projections are defined within the scenario framework of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) in climate research, in which income inequality is a qualitative dimension, but not quantified. The projections are driven primarily by total factor productivity (TFP), education attainment at different levels of education, and social public spending. We combine projections of TFP and education from the SSPs and scenarios of public spending with the historical model results to generate Ginis by SSP with uncertainty. The resulting Gini trends across SSPs are distinct and broadly consistent with the SSP narratives. Divergence in Ginis across the SSPs is strongest in emerging economies, and weakest in industrialized countries. The insights from this analysis can enrich the SSP narratives along new dimensions, such as capital and labor income shares and trade.},

abstract = {Background: The mental and physical health consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) have been well established, yet little is known about the impact of violence on a woman's ability to obtain and maintain housing. This cross-sectional study examines the relationship between recent IPV and housing instability among a representative sample of California women. It is expected that women who have experienced IPV will be at increased risk for housing instability as evidenced by: (1) late rent or mortgage, (2) frequent moves because of difficulty obtaining affordable housing, and/or (3) without their own housing. Methods: Data were taken from the 2003 California Women's Health Survey, a population-based, random-digit-dial, annual probability survey of adult California women (N=3619). Logistic regressions were used to predict housing instability in the past 12 months, adjusting for the following covariates; age, race/ethnicity, education, poverty status, marital status, children in the household, and past year IPV. Results: In the multivariate model, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, poverty, and IPV were significant predictors of housing instability. After adjusting for all covariates, women who experienced IPV in the last year had almost four times the odds of reporting housing instability than women who did not experience IPV (adjusted odds ratio=3.98, 95{\%} confidence interval: 2.94-5.39). Conclusions: This study found that IPV was associated with housing instability among California women. Future prospective studies are needed to learn more about the nature and direction of the relationship between IPV and housing instability and the possible associated negative health consequences. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

In particular, we examine the extent to which livestock, grain storage and inter-household transfers are used to smooth consumption against income risk. The survey coincided with a period of severe drought, so the results provide direct evidence on the effectiveness of these various insurance mechanisms when they are the most needed. We find evidence of little consumption smoothing. In particular, there is almost no risk sharing, and households rely almost exclusively on self-insurance in the form of adjustments to grain stocks to smooth out consumption. The outcome, however, is far from complete smoothing. Hence the main risk-coping strategies which are hypothesized in the literature (risk sharing and the use of assets as buffer stocks) were not effective during the survey period. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Background: Since 2000, the scale-up of malaria control interventions has substantially reduced morbidity and mortality caused by the disease globally, fuelling bold aims for disease elimination. In tandem with increased availability of geospatially resolved data, malaria control programmes increasingly use high-resolution maps to characterise spatially heterogeneous patterns of disease risk and thus efficiently target areas of high burden. Methods: We updated and refined the Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate and clinical incidence models for sub-Saharan Africa, which rely on cross-sectional survey data for parasite rate and intervention coverage. For malaria endemic countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa, we produced estimates of parasite rate and incidence by applying an ecological downscaling approach to malaria incidence data acquired via routine surveillance. Mortality estimates were derived by linking incidence to systematically derived vital registration and verbal autopsy data. Informed by high-resolution covariate surfaces, we estimated P falciparum parasite rate, clinical incidence, and mortality at national, subnational, and 5 × 5 km pixel scales with corresponding uncertainty metrics. Findings: We present the first global, high-resolution map of P falciparum malaria mortality and the first global prevalence and incidence maps since 2010. These results are combined with those for Plasmodium vivax (published separately) to form the malaria estimates for the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study. The P falciparum estimates span the period 2000–17, and illustrate the rapid decline in burden between 2005 and 2017, with incidence declining by 27{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} and mortality declining by 42{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}. Despite a growing population in endemic regions, P falciparum cases declined between 2005 and 2017, from 232{\textperiodcentered}3 million (95{\%} uncertainty interval 198{\textperiodcentered}8–277{\textperiodcentered}7) to 193{\textperiodcentered}9 million (156{\textperiodcentered}6–240{\textperiodcentered}2) and deaths declined from 925 800 (596 900–1 341 100) to 618 700 (368 600–952 200). Despite the declines in burden, 90{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} of people within sub-Saharan Africa continue to reside in endemic areas, and this region accounted for 79{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} of cases and 87{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} of deaths in 2017. Interpretation: High-resolution maps of P falciparum provide a contemporary resource for informing global policy and malaria control planning, programme implementation, and monitoring initiatives. Amid progress in reducing global malaria burden, areas where incidence trends have plateaued or increased in the past 5 years underscore the fragility of hard-won gains against malaria. Efforts towards elimination should be strengthened in such areas, and those where burden remained high throughout the study period. Funding: Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation.},

However, the pace of decline, particularly before 1988, has been questioned (Thomas Muvandi, 1994) a response by Blanc and Rutstein (1994) and further reply by Thomas and Muvandi (1994). The extent to which the decline can be regarded as structural, resulting from change in the education or other composition of the population of reproductive age, rather than dynamic resulting from changes within population groups, has also been questioned (Thomas and Muvandi), 1994).

abstract = {The health and nutritional status of children aged 5 and under was assessed in three villages in Siaya District of western Kenya. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 121 adults and 175 children during July 2002. Primary caretakers were interviewed during home visits to assess agricultural and sanitation resources, child feeding practices, and the nutritional status of their children aged 5 years and under. Through anthropometry, the prevalence of underweight, stunting and wasting were determined: 30 per cent were underweight, 47 per cent were stunted, and 7 per cent were wasted. Predictors of undernutrition were analysed using logistic regression controlling for age, sex, and SES, and four major findings emerged. First, children in their second year of life were more likely to be underweight and stunted. Second, children who were introduced to foods early had an increased risk of being underweight. Third, up-to-date vaccinations were protective against stunting, while reports of having upper respiratory infections or other illness in the past month predicted underweight. Finally, living with non-biological parents significantly increased risk of stunting. Emphasis should be placed on current immunization, prolonging exclusive breastfeeding, and improving access to nutrient-rich foods among adopted children and their families via community-based nutrition interventions.},

abstract = {Data are presented indicating a seasonal mosaic pattern of burning in the savanna of southern Mali. A seasonal mosaic is a landscape that is annually re-created by people, and which contains patches of unburned, early burned, and recently burned vegetation. A survey of over 100 farmers and in-depth interviews demonstrates that rural inhabitants of southern Mali begin an annual burning regime early in the dry season in order to fragment the landscape, with the goal of preventing later fires that can damage natural resources. The process of gradually burning off the driest vegetation creates a seasonal mosaic of habitat patches that increases the potential of the landscape for a variety of dry season land uses, including hunting, gathering of savanna products, and grazing. An analysis of a series of Landsat images shows that the practice of mosaic burning is widespread in the wooded savanna, in which burning usually begins early and large fires are rare. On the basis of recent developments in ecological theory and empirical evidence from similar burning regimes in parts of Australia, it is suggested that seasonal mosaic burning in Mali not only prevents damaging late-season fires but increases biodiversity. It is concluded that discourse on African savanna burning overemphasizes the ecologically detrimental aspects of fire, while neglecting the beneficial ones resulting in misguided policies that pose a threat to human livelihoods and savanna ecosystems.},

This paper presents the rationale for the inclusive valuation of nature's contributions to people (NCP) in decision making, as well as broad methodological steps for doing so. While developed within the context of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), this approach is more widely applicable to initiatives at the knowledge–policy interface, which require a pluralistic approach to recognizing the diversity of values. We argue that transformative practices aiming at sustainable futures would benefit from embracing such diversity, which require recognizing and addressing power relationships across stakeholder groups that hold different values on human nature-relations and NCP.},

abstract = {Climate variability, the short-term fluctuations in average weather conditions and agriculture affect each other. Climate variability affects the agroecological and growing conditions of crops and livestock, and is recently believed to be the greatest impediment to the realisation of the first Millennium Development Goal of reducing poverty and food insecurity in arid and semi-arid regions of developing countries. Conversely, agriculture is a major contributor to climate variability and change by emitting greenhouse gases and reducing the agroecology's potential for carbon sequestration. What however, is the empirical evidence of this inter-dependence of climate variability and agriculture in Sub-Sahara Africa? In this paper, we provide some insight into the long run relationship between inter-annual variations in temperature and rainfall, and annual yields of the most important staple food crops in Northern Ghana. Applying pooled panel data of rainfall, temperature and yields of the selected crops from 1976 to 2010 to cointegration and Granger causality models, there is cogent evidence of cointegration between seasonal, total rainfall and crop yields; and causality from rainfall to crop yields in the Sudano-Guinea Savannah and Guinea Savannah zones of Northern Ghana. This suggests that inter-annual yields of the crops have been influenced by the total amounts of rainfall in the planting season. Temperature variability over the study period is however stationary, and is suspected to have minimal effect, if any, on crop yields. Overall, the results confirm the appropriateness of our attempt in modelling long-term relationships between the climate and crop yield variables.

Data from socioeconomic and environmental indicators were analysed, and the most relevant indicators were aggregated using a composite index to compare differential vulnerabilities. The paper shows the high correlation between hunger and climate risk, especially for the regions of the world most affected by food insecurity. The analysis goes beyond the impact of climate on crop yields and provides a multidimensional analysis of vulnerability, while demonstrating the critical role that adaptive capacity has in determining vulnerability. The paper also presents a method for analysing food security vulnerability to climate risks that is replicable at different scales to provide a robust planning tool for policy makers. This approach can also be used to monitor vulnerability, evaluate potential effectiveness of programmes, and/or examine plausible impacts of climate change by introducing scenarios into the vulnerability model.},

Low-income, ethnic minority, and female-headed households exhibit the greatest risk for food insecurity, which often results in higher prevalence of diet-related disease. The food insecurity-obesity paradox is one that researchers have explored to understand the factors that influence food insecurity and its impact on weight change. The aim of this inquiry was to explore new evidence in associations of food insecurity and obesity in youth, adult, and elderly populations. A literature search of publication databases was conducted, using various criteria to identify relevant articles. Among 65 results, 19 studies conducted since 2005 were selected for review. Overall, the review confirmed that food insecurity and obesity continue to be strongly and positively associated in women. Growing evidence of this association was found in adolescents; but among children, results remain mixed. Few studies supported a linear relationship between food insecurity and weight outcomes, as suggested by an earlier review. New mediators were revealed (gender, marital status, stressors, and food stamp participation) that alter the association; in fact, newer studies suggest that food stamp participation may exacerbate obesity outcomes. Continued examination through longitudinal studies, development of tools to distinguish acute and chronic food insecurity, and greater inclusion of food security measurement tools in regional and local studies are warranted.},

Prevalence estimates from 22 surveys containing both microscopy and RDT results were compared using tests of agreement, and factors that could be influencing discordance between the two tests were identified. Although prevalence estimates from the two tests were highly correlated, RDT prevalence estimates were higher than microscopy prevalence estimates in 19 of 22 surveys examined. Given the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test for malaria that is practical for use in national survey settings, discrepancies in prevalence estimates generated from microscopy testing and from RDT testing are difficult to reconcile. Although results of these tests could be useful in identification of high-risk populations for targeting of interventions, assessments of impact based on changes in malaria prevalence measured with these tests are more problematic. Development of an algorithm for program managers to use to best estimate national prevalence given the available diagnostic data would be useful for the future. },

The author interviewed 365 battered and nonbattered women about different facets of family violence and finances and obtained reports from one of their children about abuse in the home. The author compares the relative influence of overall family resources to resource disparity between women and their partners. Asymmetry in income favoring women, rather than total family income, predicted the men's frequency and severity of abuse toward their wives. Overall combined occupational status of the couple also predicted wife abuse, but disparity in occupations did not. These findings suggest that income disparity rather than overall poverty contributes to wife abuse. Class standing as indexed by membership in lower-status occupations also is a risk factor for wife battering. Fathers or stepfathers who harm women are also more likely to abuse the children, with few effects of income and occupation after partialing out wife abuse. The author suggests that a proportion of these men use the children in a policy of coercion against the mothers. Further gender-based interpretations of economic roles and family dynamics are needed to illuminate the complex reasons for men's abuse of women and children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nutritional status of children is a good indicator of the overall well-being of a society and reflects food security as well as existing health-care and environmental conditions. In Pakistan, it is estimated that nearly 40{\%} to 50{\%} of children under the age of five are stunted. Due to greater economic opportunities available to the urban population as compared to the rural, it was believed that economic resources existed in poor urban Pakistani households but that the households lacked the skills and knowledge to translate their resources into good care and feeding practices. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed 1) to assess the prevalent care and feeding practices among children aged 6 to 18 months residing in the squatter settlements of Karachi and 2) to identify care and feeding practices, as well as any other underlying factors, associated with stunting. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in eight settlements between October and December 2000. A total of 433 mothers of eligible children were interviewed with the use of structured questionnaires. Final analysis using multiple logistic regression was conducted on 399 mother-child pairs. RESULTS: Female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child. Lack of maternal formal schooling (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 2.9; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.8) and large household size (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.7; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.8) were also associated with stunting. Even though certain care and feeding practices were significant at the univariate level, they were not significant in the final multivariate analysis and so were excluded from the final model. CONCLUSIONS: In households where food insecurity exists, knowledge of care practices may not be sufficient, and interventions such as food subsidies must precede or accompany educational efforts. Further follow-up is required to explore the effect of gender differences on child care.},

abstract = {More than 80{\%} of urban households in sub-Saharan Africa use charcoal as their main source of cooking energy, and the demand is likely to increase for several decades. Charcoal is also a major source of income for rural households in areas with access to urban markets. We review studies of the socioeconomic implications of charcoal production and use, focusing holistically on the role of charcoal in poverty alleviation based on four dimensions of poverty defined by the World Bank: (i) material deprivation, (ii) poor health and education, (iii) vulnerability and exposure to risk, and (iv) voicelessness and powerlessness. We draw conclusions from household-level studies to better understand the determinants of participation in charcoal production and sale, and of urban household demand. Poorer households are more likely to participate in the production and sale of charcoal but their participation is mainly a safety net to supplement other income. Although charcoal production contributes to poverty reduction through alternative income-generation opportunities, it can also undermine production of ecosystem services, agricultural production, and human health. Reducing rural household dependence on charcoal requires coordinated policies providing alternative income opportunities for farmers, affordable alternative energy sources for urban households, and more efficient and sustainable approaches for producing and using charcoal. For future research, we emphasize the importance of large-N panel datasets to better understand the net benefits of charcoal production as a poverty-reduction strategy. ?? 2012 International Energy Initiative.},

We used crop productions (cereals and oilseeds), livestock, monthly rainfall and temperature, and child under nutrition data for the period of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2004. We applied panel regression fixed effects model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The study included 43 clusters (administrative zones) and 145 observations. We observed a spatio temporal variability of rainfall, stunting and underweight. We estimated that for a given zone, one standard deviation increase in rainfall leads to 0.242 standard deviations increase in moderate stunting. Additionally, a one standard deviation increase temperature leads to 0.216 standard deviations decrease in moderate stunting. However, wasting was found to be poorly related with rainfall and temperature. But severe wasting showed a positive relationship with the quadratic term of rainfall.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that rainfall and temperature are partly predicting the variation in child stunting and underweight. Models vary in predicting stunting and underweight across the three agro ecologic zones. This could indicate that a single model for the three agro ecologies may not be not applicable.},

abstract = {This study examines challenges associated with early stages of decentralizing the administration and management of forest resources in the Centre-West Region of Burkina Faso. It is based on fieldwork using rapid rural appraisal, focus group discussions and interviews with key stakeholders, methodology to explore the strengths and weaknesses of participatory forest management, and the main issues and challenges involved in these processes. The study found that a shift of administrative authority to the local level will not guarantee transparency and good governance in the forest sector unless measures are taken to remove challenging obstacles. The central government is still reluctant to decentralize a revenue-generating sector such as forestry and the involvement of civil society remains weak. Decentralization also results in a plethora of conflicts at the local level as new responsibilities and opportunities arise with the devolution of new powers to the community. Decentralization of forest management will probably remain a work in progress for the foreseeable future. Thus, we recommend the introduction or reinforcement of participatory development programs through local dialogue with various stakeholders and an investigation of new policy and institutional arrangements that may promote equitable forest management. {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

The papers, commissioned by the MEASURE DHS project, were prepared by researchers recognized for their work in the areas of demography, reproductive health, and gender.  A common theme of several of the papers is the struggle to define women?s empowerment and/or autonomy and then to adequately measure it. Five of the working papers in this volume focus on the gender questions in the core DHS questionnaire, particularly the questions on household decision making and women?s autonomy and empowerment, and their relationship to different population, health, and nutrition (PHN) outcomes of interest. The last paper examines whether PHN outcomes of interest vary by women?s experience of domestic violence. The PHN outcomes studied by the papers include child health, nutrition, mortality, women?s nutrition, maternal care and reproductive health, as well as condom use and thetheir risk of sexually transmitted infections and condom uses. },

abstract = {This study takes a multilevel approach to identify determinants of women?s use of modern contraceptives in Nepal and Rwanda. Data for this study come primarily from the 2011 NDHS and the 2010 RDHS, and also draw from spatial data sources to measure community levels of socioeconomic development. The study focuses on rural women who do not wish to have a child within the next two years, a subset of women of particular interest to family planning policymakers. We explore the extent to which four spheres of community-level influence?socioeconomic development, women?s empowerment, fertility norms, and access to family planning information and services?shape women?s contraceptive use, after adjusting for women?s individual socio-demographic characteristics and for other contextual factors. A sequence of random-effects logit regression models are run?separately for Rwanda and Nepal.  Overall, results from this study indicate the relevance for family planning programs of the community context in which women live. The demand for family planning services is influenced not only by women?s individual and household characteristics, but also by the community?s socioeconomic development, its access and exposure to family planning, the gender norms of local community members regarding decision-making for family planning and health issues, and community norms regarding marriage and childbirth. Among the factors we explored, the analysis suggests that socioeconomic development and access to family planning services may play a bigger role in affecting women?s contraceptive behaviors than the community?s norms regarding gender and fertility. },

abstract = {Unmet need for family planning is defined using survey data as the percentage of women who do not want to become pregnant but are not using contraception.  Though the concept seems straightforward, the calculation is extraordinarily complex and has changed over time. To address these issues, DHS revised the definition of unmet need in 2012. Using the revised definition:(1)Unmet need is calculated the same way in all DHS surveys.(2)Unmet need is calculated the same way in DHS and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).(3)Unmet need can be used to reliably track trends over time and compare estimates across countries. This paper describes the rationale, process, and results of revising the definition of unmet need, and compares estimates of unmet need using the original and revised definitions for all DHS surveys from 1990-2010. The study also estimates unmet need for spacing and limiting, unmet need by background characteristics, total demand for family planning and the proportion of demand satisfied, and unmet need for sexually active unmarried women, all using the revised definition. },

abstract = {Multiple-species parasitic infections are pervasive in the developing world, yet resources for their control are scarce. We present an integrated approach for risk profiling and spatial prediction of coinfection with Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm for western C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire. Our approach combines demographic, environmental, and socioeconomic data; incorporates them into a geographic information system; and employs spatial statistics. Demographic and socioeconomic data were obtained from education registries and from a questionnaire administered to schoolchildren. Environmental data were derived from remotely sensed satellite images and digitized ground maps. Parasitologic data, obtained from fecal examination by using two different diagnostic approaches, served as the outcome measure. Bayesian variogram models were used to assess risk factors and spatial variation of S. mansoni-hookworm coinfection in relation to demographic, environmental, and socioeconomic variables. Coinfections were found in 680 of 3,578 schoolchildren (19.0{\%}) with complete data records. The prevalence of monoinfections with either hookworm or S. mansoni was 24.3{\%} and 24.1{\%}, respectively. Multinomial Bayesian spatial models showed that age, sex, socioeconomic status, and elevation were good predictors for the spatial distribution of S. mansoni-hookworm coinfection. We conclude that our integrated approach, employing a diversity of data sources, geographic information system and remote sensing technologies, and Bayesian spatial statistics, is a powerful tool for risk profiling and spatial prediction of S. mansoni-hookworm coinfection. More generally, this approach facilitates risk mapping and prediction of other parasite combinations and multiparasitism, and hence can guide integrated disease control programs in resource-constrained settings.},

abstract = {Background: Electronegative LDL (LDL(-)) is a minor modified LDL fraction present in plasma that has been demonstrated to be inflammatory in endothelial cells isolated from human umbilical vein (HUVEC). Methods: A protein array able to measure 42 cytokines, chemokines and related compounds involved in atherogenesis was used to determine their release into the culture medium of human arterial endothelial cells (HUAEC) activated or not by two low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions isolated from human plasma by anion-exchange chromatography. Results: The results of the protein array (confirmed using specific ELISAs for each induced factor) revealed that HUAEC in the absence of stimuli released small amounts of interleukin 8 (IL-8), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and growth-related oncogene (GRO). The major native LDL fraction (named LDL(+)) increased the release of these molecules and also those of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and GRO??. Compared to LDL(+), the minor modified fraction, named electronegative LDL (LDL(-)), increased all these factors to a greater degree and also induced the release of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B). These results were confirmed by ELISA. Conclusions: All these results indicate that, compared to LDL(+), LDL(-) fraction promotes not only the release of proinflammatory factors but also those of atherogenic factors in endothelial cells of arterial origin, thereby suggesting a new role for LDL(-) in atherogenesis. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, global water supply and demand as well as the linkages between water supply and food security are examined. The analysis reveals that the water for food security situation is intricate and might get daunting if no action is taken. Investments are needed today for enhancing future food security; this requires action on several fronts, including tackling climate change, preserving land and conserving water, reducing the energy footprint in food systems, developing and adopting climate resilient varieties, modernising irrigation infrastructure, shoring up domestic food supplies, reforming international food trade, and responding to other global challenges. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

The average height of adult women increased from 157.3 cm for cohorts born in 1940 to 158.7 cm for cohorts born in 1965, then decreased to 157.5 cm for cohorts born in 1990. Trends in women?s height were highly correlated with the rise and fall in income per capita at the time of adolescence for the same cohorts. This pattern of a rise in height followed by a fall was not universal. In affluent countries of Southern Africa, trends in height were only positive. In Sahelian countries, there was no negative trend in urban areas, and only the rural areas underwent a minor decline. The largest declines were in Coastal West Africa, Central Africa, and most of Eastern Africa. Trends in BMI were assessed using an age pattern for women between age 15 and 49 years. In countries of Southern Africa, the BMI was much higher than elsewhere, was increasing fast with age, and the age effect tended to increase with time. In Sahelian countries, the BMI was much lower but tended to catch up with time. In countries of Coastal West Africa, Central Africa, and Eastern Africa, cohort trends were not linear: the age standardized BMI tended to first increase, then to decrease with time, and the negative trends were larger in urban areas. Weight gains with age were very small in most of Eastern African countries. },

The study uses women?s birth histories to construct panel data that enable calculation of fertility by mother?s birth cohort. The panel comprises women born between 1937 and 1990 and covers their fertility behavior between 1952 and 2005. The study?s focus on cohort trends in fertility distinguishes it from many other studies of fertility transition and enables examination of women?s fertility over their own lifetimes, rather than what fertility rates at a single point in time.   Over the past five decades, most countries studied show signs of fertility decline in the cohort measures examined. Comparing women born between 1950 and 1959 with those born between 1960 and 1969 reveals that 17 of the 30 countries studied show rates of fertility decline indicative of fertility transition. However, there is significant variation among countries in fertility levels and trends. This study also finds some ?stalling? in fertility declines in a few countries, as decreases in fertility become less pronounced than in the past.  },

abstract = {Introduction: Every year millions of children die before reaching their fifth birthday. While the effect of the length of birth interval on child health and survival is well established, there has been little exploration of the links between birth intervals and causes of under-five mortality at either global or regional levels. The purpose of this study is to explore the association between birth intervals and specific causes of death  for children under age 5 years in Afghanistan.  Method: This study is a retrospective analysis of data from the 2010 Afghanistan Mortality Survey (AMS 2010). The analysis is limited to deaths of children under age 5 years that occurred in the three years before the survey. The dependent variable is the cause-specific mortality rate (CSMR) among children under age 5. The key independent variable is the length of the preceding birth interval, measured as the number of months between the birth of the child under study and the immediately preceding birth to the mother, if any. The analysis used both bivariate and multivariate designs.  Results: After adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, children with a previous birth interval of less than 18 months have a higher risk of dying from certain causes of death, including sepsis and diarrhea, than children with a previous birth interval of 24-35 months (the reference category). Children with a previous birth interval of at least 60 months also have a higher risk of dying from certain causes, including diarrhea and low birth weight, than children with a previous birth interval of 24-35 months.  Conclusion: The AMS 2010 provides a rich dataset that can be analyzed and used to generate new information for planners, program managers, and policymakers. This study, which combines data from the survey on causes of death with other covariates of the risk of death of children under age 5, has shown mechanisms by which the length of birth intervals may be related to the risks of dying in childhood. In particular, the length of birth intervals is significantly related to mortality risk from diarrhea, sepsis, and low birth weight. Further analyses in other settings are needed to confirm the generalizability of these conclusions and to establish whether children with non-optimal birth intervals are more likely to contract these diseases or to have higher case fatalities, or both.},

General recommendations derived from these results are already standard practice in the DHS surveys:(1) All due emphasis should be placed on hiring interviewers based on their knowledge of local languages, proportional to the distribution of languages among clusters.(2) Ensuring that questionnaires are translated into as many local languages as practicable is likely to be a useful step toward improving data quality.(3) The beginning and end of the fieldwork period may be particularly sensitive times, as interviewers are first learning the practice in the beginning and, toward the end of fieldwork, may be fatigued and want to go back to their families. These realities call for increased, careful supervision of fieldwork during these sensitive periods, with an eye to ensuring that fieldworkers have the support that they need to do their job well. },

abstract = {The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was developed in 2010 and has been used in an increasing number of climatology and hydrology studies. The objective of this article is to describe computing options that provide flexible and robust use of the SPEI. In particular, we present methods for estimating the parameters of the log-logistic distribution for obtaining standardized values, methods for computing reference evapotranspiration (ET0), and weighting kernels used for calculation of the SPEI at different time scales. We discuss the use of alternative ET0 and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) methods and different options on the resulting SPEI series by use of observational and global gridded data. The results indicate that the equation used to calculate ET0 can have a significant effect on the SPEI in some regions of the world. Although the original formulation of the SPEI was based on plotting-positions Probability Weighted Moment (PWM), we now recommend use of unbiased PWM for model fitting. Finally, we present new software tools for computation and analysis of SPEI series, an updated global gridded database, and a real-time drought-monitoring system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The current individual income taxation structure of the Philippines signifcantly violates several norms of equity, with wage and salary workers (wsws) being disproportionately burdened by income taxes. An important source of inequity is the phenomenon of “bracket creep” resulting from the failure to adjust tax brackets by infation. Another is the failure of a large number of the self-employed to pay the right taxes. We show that while infation-adjustment of tax brackets results in revenue losses, an expansion of the tax base, a simplifcation of the income tax structure, and a reduction of tax rates can plug this leak. Using data from the merged 2013 Labor Force Survey and 2012 Family Income and Expenditures Survey, we estimate a set of tax rates that largely offsets the revenue losses from infation-adjusted tax brackets. A key behavioral premise, supported by a multivariate logit analysis, is that the likelihood of paying income taxes increases with lower effective tax rates. Under the personal income tax structure proposed here, 36 percent of the income tax burden would be borne by the 2 top tax brackets—a seven percentage-point increase over the current share. Implementing these tax reforms, however, requires improvements in tax administ},

Through a meta-analysis of published case-studies, we compare land use/cover change data for these two broad types of forest management and assess their performance in maintaining forest cover. Case studies included 40 protected areas and 33 community managed forests from the peer reviewed literature. A statistical comparison of annual deforestation rates and a Qualitative Comparative Analysis were conducted. We found that as a whole, community managed forests presented lower and less variable annual deforestation rates than protected forests. We consider that a more resilient and robust forest conservation strategy should encompass a regional vision with different land use types in which social and economic needs of local inhabitants, as well as tenure rights and local capacities, are recognized. Further research for understanding institutional arrangements that derive from local governance in favor of tropical forest conservation is recommended. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Acceleration of progress in nutrition will require effective, large-scale nutrition-sensitive programmes that address key underlying determinants of nutrition and enhance the coverage and effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions. We reviewed evidence of nutritional effects of programmes in four sectors - agriculture, social safety nets, early child development, and schooling. The need for investments to boost agricultural production, keep prices low, and increase incomes is undisputable; targeted agricultural programmes can complement these investments by supporting livelihoods, enhancing access to diverse diets in poor populations, and fostering women's empowerment. However, evidence of the nutritional effect of agricultural programmes is inconclusive - except for vitamin A from biofortification of orange sweet potatoes - largely because of poor quality evaluations. Social safety nets currently provide cash or food transfers to a billion poor people and victims of shocks (eg, natural disasters). Individual studies show some effects on younger children exposed for longer durations, but weaknesses in nutrition goals and actions, and poor service quality probably explain the scarcity of overall nutritional benefits. Combined early child development and nutrition interventions show promising additive or synergistic effects on child development - and in some cases nutrition - and could lead to substantial gains in cost, efficiency, and effectiveness, but these programmes have yet to be tested at scale. Parental schooling is strongly associated with child nutrition, and the effectiveness of emerging school nutrition education programmes needs to be tested. Many of the programmes reviewed were not originally designed to improve nutrition yet have great potential to do so. Ways to enhance programme nutrition-sensitivity include: improve targeting; use conditions to stimulate participation; strengthen nutrition goals and actions; and optimise women's nutrition, time, physical and mental health, and empowerment. Nutrition-sensitive programmes can help scale up nutrition-specific interventions and create a stimulating environment in which young children can grow and develop to their full potential. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It has been well established that a strong correlation exists at the national level between contraceptive use and fertility rates. The relationship can be summarised statistically using a linear regression of the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) on the total fertility rate (TFR). A recent version of this regression based on more than 100 observations indicates that for every increase of 15 percentage points in the use of contraception among married women, a decline of one child in the total fertility rate may be expected. Significant deviations from this expectation have been noted in a number of studies. In this study, we examine fertility decline in Ghana that is larger than expected on the basis of contraceptive use. Our primary sources of data are three Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in the country in 1988, 1993, and 1998. We examine the evidence for three possible explanations of the TFR-CPR inconsistency. First, we consider the joint trends in fertility and contraceptive prevalence in Ghana and compare them to the trends that would be expected on the basis of prior research.  Next, we attempt to uncover the explanation behind this unexpected finding. Finally, we consider the possibility that couples use adjustments in their coital frequency to obtain their fertility desires, behavior that would influence fertility rates but would not be captured by conventional measures of the proximate determinants of fertility.},

We investigated the efficiency of MODIS fire products to account for the variability of fire regimes in relation to changes in land cover and savanna vegetation. The specificity and complementarities of both MODIS active fire (MOD14A2 and MYD14A2) and burnt area (MCD45A1) products were assessed in order to characterize fire regimes and to relate them with land cover. In addition the distribution of plant species among landscape units characterised by specific fire regimes was assessed. The calculation of the mutual information made it possible to set apart species more frequent in landscapes little or not at all subject to fire and species more frequent in burnt areas. The first group is the expression of the nature of the unburnt land-cover units, made up mainly of the agricultural areas dominated by fields and fallows. It consists of more potential threats (weeds, encroachers, invasive species etc.) than the second group, which is more typical of sudanian savannas, where fire provides the long-term stability needed to preserve the ecosystem. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems provide a number of vital services for people and society, such as biodiversity, food, fibre, water resources, carbon sequestration, and recreation. The future capability of ecosystems to provide these services is determined by changes in socio-economic characteristics, land use, biodiversity, atmospheric composition and climate. Most published impact assessments do not address the vulnerability of the human-environment system under such environmental change. They cannot answer important multidisciplinary policy relevant questions such as: which are the main regions or sectors that are vulnerable to global change? How do the vulnerabilities of two regions compare? Which scenario is the least, or most, harmful for a given region or sector? The ATEAM project (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) uses a new approach to ecosystem assessment by integrating the potential impacts in a vulnerability assessment, which can help answer multidisciplinary questions, such as those listed above. This paper presents the vulnerability assessment of the ATEAM land use scenarios. The 14 land use types, discussed in detail by Rounsevell et al. (this volume), can be related to a range of ecosystem services. For instance, forest area is associated with wood production and designated land with outdoor recreation. Directly applying the vulnerability methodology to the land use change scenarios helps in understanding land use change impacts across the European environment. Scatter plots summarising impacts per principal European Environmental Zone (EnZ) help in interpreting how the impacts of the scenarios differ between ecosystem services and the European environments. While there is considerable heterogeneity in both the potential impacts of global changes, and the adaptive capacity to cope with these impacts, this assessment shows that southern Europe in particular will be vulnerable to land use change. Projected economic growth increases adaptive capacity, but is also associated with the most negative potential impacts. The potential impacts of more environmentally oriented developments are smaller, indicating an important role for both policy and society in determining eventual residual impacts. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Terrestrial wildlife is the primary source of meat for hundreds of millions of people throughout the developing world. Despite widespread human reliance on wildlife for food, the impact of wildlife depletion on human health remains poorly understood. Here we studied a prospective longitudinal cohort of 77 preadolescent children (under 12 y of age) in rural northeastern Madagascar and show that consuming more wildlife was associated with significantly higher hemoglobin concentrations. Our empirical models demonstrate that removing access to wildlife would induce a 29{\%} increase in the numbers of children suffering from anemia and a tripling of anemia cases among children in the poorest households. The well-known progression from anemia to future disease demonstrates the powerful and far-reaching effects of lost wildlife access on a variety of human health outcomes, including cognitive, motor, and physical deficits. Loss of access to wildlife could arise either from the diligent enforcement of existing conservation policy or from unbridled unsustainable harvest, leading to depletion. Conservation enforcement would enact a more rapid restriction of resources, but self-depletion would potentially lead, albeit more slowly, both to irrevocable local wildlife extinctions and loss of the harvested resource. Our research quantifies costs of reduced access to wildlife for a rural community in Madagascar and illuminates pathways that may broadly link reduced natural resource access to declines in childhood health.},

abstract = {Non-timber forest products (NTFP), mainly edible mushrooms, forest berries, and medicinal plants, are of socio-economic importance in the Czech Republic (CR). They can be picked freely by forest visitors for their own use, irrespective of forest ownership. There is a century long tradition of foraging for wild food in the Czech forests and this article presents an analysis of the trends in the apparent socio-economic importance of the collection and use of NTFP for the inhabitants in the CR over the last 20 years.Data concerning the collection and use of NTFP in the CR have been systematically analysed every year since 1994 and, thus, a unique time series, even on the European level, has been obtained. The results of the analyses demonstrate that NTFP collection is an important activity for the inhabitants of the CR. Investigations based on questionnaire surveys in representative samples of CR citizens (quota selection) show that about 3/4 of the households report collecting NTFP. On average, 10.6. kg of principal NTFP (mushrooms and berries) were picked by every household annually in 1994-2013, which amounts to 39.1. mil. kg (almost 4. kg/capita), and 3100. mil. Czech Crowns (CZK), in the total CR. This value corresponds to 1/6 of the timber harvest value in an average year. Nevertheless, (in recent years) the share is even higher, exceeding 20{\%} of the timber harvest value. A comparatively small part of the population collect NTFP to save money and an even lower share sell NTFP. The data obtained in these studies aims to improve the quality of the state forestry policy focused on the optimum use of NTFP, to enhance the income from forests, to support NTFP commercial production and to raise the level of forest conservation.},

abstract = {Background: A high number of women report experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). It is of utmost importance to identify possible factors that precipitate IPV and incorporate them into police protocols for evaluating IPV risk. Scientific evidence shows that environmental temperature is associated with a risk of violent behavior. Objectives: To analyze the effect and impact of heat waves on the risk of IPV. Methods: Ecological, longitudinal time series study. The dependent variables are: intimate partner femicides (IPF), reports of IPV and 016 IPV telephone help line calls in the Community of Madrid from 05/01 to 09/30 in the years 2008–2016. The principal independent variable is the daily maximum temperature in Celsius (Tmax) above the heat wave threshold of 34 °C. A binomial negative regression was used for calls and reports and a Poisson regression was used for IPF. The attributable risk among those exposed (AR{\%}) and the number of attributable cases was calculated for each variable. Results: The risk of IPF increased three days after the heat wave, [RR(IC95{\%}):1.40(1.00–1.97)], police reports of IPV increased one day after [RR (IC95{\%}):1.02(1.00–1.03) and help line calls increased five days after [RR(IC95{\%}):1.01(1.00–1.03)]. The AR{\%} was 28.8{\%} (IC95{\%}: 0.3{\%}–49.2{\%}) for IPF, 1.7{\%} (IC95{\%}:0.3{\%}–3.1{\%}) for police reports and 1.43{\%} (IC95:0.1{\%};2.8{\%}) for help line calls. Conclusions: Our results suggest that heat waves are associated with an increase in IPV. The effect of an increase in IPV is delayed in time, with differences according to the violence indicators analyzed.},

Our study probes the link between biodiversity-related knowledge and self-reported pro-conservation behaviour, based on the largest and most international study of zoo visitors ever conducted. In total, 6,357 visitors to 30 zoos from 19 countries around the globe participated in the study. Biodiversity understanding and knowledge of actions to help protect biodiversity were significantly related, but only 0.6{\%} of the variation in knowledge of actions to help protect biodiversity could be explained by those same respondents' biodiversity understanding. Biodiversity understanding was only the sixth most important variable in significantly predicting knowledge of actions to help protect biodiversity. Moreover, biodiversity understanding was the least important variable of those that were significantly related to self-reported pro-conservation behaviour. Our study indicates that knowledge is a real, but relatively minor, factor in predicting whether members of the public – zoo visitors in this case – will know about specific pro-environment behaviours they can take, let alone whether they will actually undertake such behaviours.},

Population attributable risk calculations indicate 26{\%} excess under-five mortality due to birth to conception intervals shorter than 36 months. Children conceived after longer intervals are less likely to be stunted and underweight for their age.  Giving birth at less than 18 years old or at 35 years or older increases the risks of dying and of being stunted. A child with all three fertility risk factors is twice as likely to die before reaching age five as a child with no risk factors, and if the child survives, she/he is thirty percent more likely to be suffering from chronic malnutrition. },

Accounting for potential endogeneity of empowerment, we find that increases in women's empowerment are positively associated with calorie availability and dietary diversity at the household level. Overall, household wealth, education, and occupation are more important than women's empowerment as determinants of adult nutritional status, although negative impacts of group membership and credit on male BMI suggest that intrahousehold trade-offs may exist. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This report considers DHS surveys in the first half of the 1990s in six sub-Saharan African countries- Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Namibia, and Zambia, and in Morocco, where a panel survey was conducted during the same time period.  Results indicate that people who are more educated and those living in cities are more likely to be exposed to the mass media and to be oriented toward fertility regulation.  Thus, these covariates were controlled for, along with numerous other related variables.  The general conclusion of the research is that there is a persistent and frequently strong association between exposure to mass media and reproductive behavior in the expected direction.  Mass media is associated with greater use of contraception, intention to use contraception, preferences for fewer children, and later age at marriage. },

Results show that temperature shocks severely affect household welfare, reducing consumption, food consumption and daily caloric intake. The negative welfare effects are more severe for households where land is solely managed by women, a finding that sheds light on the gender-unequal impact of temperature shocks. Our evidence also suggests that women's vulnerability to temperature shocks is linked to women's land tenure security, as temperature shocks significantly impact women's welfare only in patrilineal districts, where statistics show that investment in agricultural technologies is lower.},

For some of these indicators, the improvements were not always equitable or significant for all subgroups of women. However, improvements in access to antenatal and postnatal care were successful in closing gaps between subgroups of women. Similar improvements in equity are needed for the remaining maternal health indicators. There were only small and mainly nonsignificant changes for women with high-risk fertility behavior, a finding that indicates the need to increase education and awareness among women and in communities on the dangers of risky childbearing behavior. Further improvements in infrastructure, availability of commodities, training in emergency obstetric care,and referral systems are required if Sierra Leone is to achieve better maternal health.},

Five principal measures were used in the analysis on infertility: childlessness, primary and secondary infertility, self-reported infecundity, and indications of secondary infecundity. In addition, levels of sexual experience, pregnancy, and live births were measured. Overall, by age 45 to 49, only 3 percent of sexually experienced women have not had a birth. Seventeen percent of women age 15 to 49 report themselves as infecund. In this study, a woman is considered secondarily sterile if she has not had a child in the past five years, although she was continuously married and did not use contraception during that period. Secondary sterility is most common in sub-Saharan Africa. The study estimates that in 2002, more than 186 million ever-married women of reproductive age (15 to 49) in the developing countries (excluding China) were infertile because of primary or secondary infertility. This number represents more than one-fourth of the ever-married women of reproductive age in these countries. However, using comparable data, the study shows that infertility, both primary and secondary, has declined in most countries. There is no obvious pattern to changes in the levels of infertility in the countries most affected by HIV. Finally, the study examines some of the consequences and coping mechanisms of couples affected by infertility. },

There is a dearth of studies which use a social inclusions lens to understand the impacts of climate change on gender. Other social markers that give an in-depth insight of the social differences within and between genders to the impacts of climate change are consequently ignored.  Methods: Utilizing a mixed methods approach, this study aimed to explore and investigate the gendered crops grown as a climate adaptation strategy to respond to perennial droughts, increased temperatures and unreliable rainfall patterns amongst the Shona in Marondera rural district.  Results: The findings indicated that social differences between gender lines like age, household types, income, education and employment status amongst other social variables produce differentiated vulnerabilities and potential opportunities towards climate adaptation.  Conclusions: The main position advanced in this article is that treating gender as the primary cause of vulnerability produces a narrow analysis making other social markers (age, types of households, income and ethnicity) analytically invisible. This paper recommends a holistic and comprehensive analysis to inform climate change programming and policy frameworks. This would in turn address and improve climate adaptation strategies within and between genders which are often obscured to address the needs of all vulnerable members of a given economy. },

abstract = {Stunting is a process that can affect the development of a child from the early stages of conception and until the third or fourth year of life, when the nutrition of the mother and the child are essential determinants of growth. Failure to meet micronutrient requirements, a challenging environment and the inadequate provision of care, are all factors responsible for this condition that affects almost 200 million children under 5 years of age. The timing and duration of the nutritional insult leads to different physiological consequences. Growth retardation is however just one feature of a complex syndrome including developmental delay, impaired immune function, reduced cognitive function and metabolic disturbances leading to increased prospective risk of obesity and hypertension. Prevention is possible by undertaking interventions at all stages of the life cycle, and mainly involves the promotion of exclusive breast-feeding until the age of 6 months and the provision of complementary foods and family foods with adequate micronutrient density. Treatment is possible, at least until the age of 5, and can lead to reversal of all the symptoms, although further research is required to clarify whether accelerating growth velocity might also lead to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {Over the past 30 years, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program has conducted more than 300 household surveys in over 90 countries. As the number of countries with multiple surveys has risen, there is an increased opportunity for comparisons of health in relation to economic status over time. However, the DHS Wealth Index, which ranks relative economic standing among surveyed households, is computed separately for each survey. Existing approaches to make the DHS Wealth Index comparable across surveys appear to encounter problems when comparing early DHS surveys to later DHS surveys; the latter frequently contain triple the number of questions related to wealth than earlier surveys. This study focuses on the particular challenge of conducting intertemporal analysis using DHS data from the mid-1990s to the present. It demonstrates how to generate a Harmonized Wealth Index (HWI) based on common assets and services across surveys.  In eight focal countries?Bangladesh, Bolivia, Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Nepal, and Zimbabwe?we use pooled household data to compute an HWI. Results show that the HWI is highly correlated with the existing DHS Wealth Index. Loss of information due to asset harmonization compresses the index, but this occurs primarily toward the top of the distribution in the most recent survey; except for Bolivia in 1998 and Ghana in 2008, the HWI appears to perform well at differentiating gradations of poverty. Overall, the HWI approach is a promising avenue for analysts and policymakers interested in intertemporal comparisons of health and poverty in specific countries. },

abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e. either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define new appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate for the first time the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

This paper presents a methodology for quantifying and assessing changes in multiple ecosystems services as a result of land use change using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The model was used to map and quantify biodiversity and four ecosystem services for Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire for 2000, 2005 and 2009 land use conditions: water yield, carbon storage, nutrient retention, and sediment retention. The study developed a suite of indices to analyze land use change impacts on the status, change and spatial patterns of multiple ecosystem services. On a national scale, the results show a mix of increases in service (water yield, N retention and P retention in Ghana, and, N and P retention in Cote d'Ivoire), little change in services (sediment retention in Ghana and sediment retention and water yield in Cote d'Ivoire) and decreases in services (biodiversity and carbon storage in both countries) from 2000 to 2009. The assessment illustrates a methodology that can be employed by land managers in exploring multiple management scenarios and their implications for multiple ecosystem services change. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The need to make informed decisions that move us toward a more sustainable future is increasingly recognized. The com- plex social, economic and ecological trade-offs involved in seeking sustainable solutions pose many challenges, notably the lack of information providing a systemic understanding of the linkages between decisions and actions and subsequent changes in community dynamics. By extension, decision- makers frequently fail to fully understand and account for the comprehensive environmental, human health, economic, and social consequences of decisions. Wellbeing measures are often used in descriptions of ob- served outcomes related to policy decisions yet rarely do these measures represent wholly integrated metrics culled from a cross-section of all relevant community sectors (Diener et al. 2008). Even fewer considerwhat people value in the context of wellbeing and decision-making. As a consequence, many existing wellbeing indices are developed solely within the context of professional expertise. The exclusion of relevant non-expert or public perception often culminates with wellbeing measures that are heavily influenced by what pro- fessionals expect rather than representing an approximation of reality. In a broader sense, public perception helps to further underscore the drivers of social norms and the perceived im- pacts of decision-making on wellbeing. We are currently developing an approach for calculating a human wellbeing index that will become a predicted endpoint for a decision support tool that bundles relevant service flow mea- sures from capital-based modules (e.g., social-capital, economiccapital, and natural-capital).The integratedmodules, as described by Summers et al.(2012)and Smith et al.(2013), are intended to reflect the degree to which changes in service provisioning influence overall human wellbeing. The structural framework for creating this index has been developed to account for societal values (public perception) associated with these services rela- tive to wellbeing. This paper describes the development and demonstrates the use of relative importance values as contribu- tion weights that integrate professional opinion and public perception to help elucidate the linkages between economic, social and ecosystem services and wellbeing. We use ecosys- tem services, broadly defined as the products of ecological functions or processes that directly or indirectly contribute to human wellbeing, or have the potential to do so in the future (World Resources Institute 2003;Brown et al. 2007;Nicholson et al. 2009), as an example for developing these weighting factors based on their relationships to the domains and elements describedinTable 1. The contribution weights are intended to be used in the construction of a U.S. human wellbeing index (HWBI) and to develop wellbeing production functions.},

abstract = {Coastal waters are important in linking zoobenthos and fish, as many coastal fishes feed on benthic prey in these habitats. Major drivers, such as eutrophication and climate change, may alter this link, whereas shifts in the importance of these drivers may induce different responses in zoobenthos and fish, respectively, potentially changing productivity of coastal ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess in which way abundance and distribution of benthic-feeding fish and biomass of zoobenthos have changed over time in response to eutrophication (Secchi depth) and climate change (temperature and salinity), respectively. This was done by analyzing gross changes in the responses over three decades (1983–2012) and across depth zones. Eutrophication and climate change caused different though specific impacts on fish and zoobenthos, respectively. Throughout the 1980s, increasing benthic-feeding fish abundance in shallow waters ({\textless}6 m) was primarily attributed to eutrophication (decreasing Secchi depth), implying increased system productivity. During the 2000s, the effect of eutrophication levelled out, whereas temperature caused contrasting development of fish abundance at different depth zones. Shallow waters had lower fish abundances during warm years compared with colder ones, while the abundance increased in deeper, aphotic waters (6–20 m). In the deep waters, zoobenthos showed a contrasting, declining trend in biomass, coinciding with the decrease in salinity during the 2000s. This suggests altered ecosystem productivity and potential food shortage for benthic-feeding fish exploring the deep waters. An intensification of these trends is likely in the future, as climate change scenarios suggest further temperature increase and salinity decrease.},

It provides an integrated view of cli- mate change as the final part of the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Re- port (AR4). Topic 1 summarises observed changes in climate and their ef- fects on natural and human systems, regardless of their causes, while Topic 2 assesses the causes of the observed changes. Topic 3 pre- sents projections of future climate change and related impacts un- der different scenarios. Topic 4 discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the next few decades and their interactions with sustainable develop- ment. Topic 5 assesses the relationship between adaptation and mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longer-term per- spective. Topic 6 summarises the major robust findings and remain- ing key uncertainties in this assessment. A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers, impacts of and responses to climate change, and their linkages, is shown in Figure I.1. At the time of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts from socio-economic information and emissions. With increased under- standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages also counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path- ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.},

abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species' range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Endemicity data from the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) 2007 and 2010 raster, as well as the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa (MARA) suitability for transmission raster, were used to quantify risk of malaria from population-based surveys (DHS, MIS, and an AMP).  In Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe; stratification of households by endemicity zones shows that households in the high/intermediate endemicity zones are significantly more likely to own at least one ITN compared with households in the no/low zones or with all households. Stratification of households by seasonality shows that in some countries people living in areas surveyed during the malaria season are significantly more likely to have slept under an ITN the night before the survey compared with the national average. These results remain significant in logistic regressions that control for other factors. The analysis demonstrates that malaria endemicity and seasonality are crucial factors to be taken into account when examining ITN ownership and use. Countries with heterogeneity of malaria transmission could benefit from the approach used in this paper. Seasonality has an influence on ITN use that is little understood and difficult to analyze, especially in cross-sectional population-based surveys. This analysis suggests that accounting for malaria endemicity and seasonality in ITN ownership and use is possible when GPS locations are available from population-based surveys. },

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {This invited review and opinion piece, assesses the impact of climate change on mycotoxins in food: only one paper and an abstract referred directly from a substantial literature search and then only in relation to Europe. Climate change is an accepted probability by most scientists. Favourable temperature and water activity are crucial for mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxin production. Fungal diseases of crops provide relevant information for pre-harvest mycotoxin contamination. However, the mycotoxin issue also involves post-harvest scenarios. There are no data on how mycotoxins affect competing organisms in crop ecosystems. In general, if the temperature increases in cool or temperate climates, the relevant countries may become more liable to aflatoxins. Tropical countries may become too inhospitable for conventional fungal growth and mycotoxin production. Could this lead to the extinction of thermotolerant Aspergillus flavus? Currently cold regions may become liable to temperate problems concerning ochratoxin A, patulin and Fusarium toxins (e.g. deoxynivalenol). Regions which can afford to control the environment of storage facilities may be able to avoid post-harvest problems but at high additional cost. There appears to be a lack of awareness of the issue in some non-European countries. The era will provide numerous challenges for mycotoxicologists. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although farmers have managed west African parkland savanna systems for 1,000 of years, concerns have been raised about the sustainability of these agro-ecosystems due to human population growth, shortening of fallow periods, droughts, desertification and new orientations towards cash generation away from subsistence farming. We conducted a tree diversity survey in 16 villages from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Senegal, recording total species composition for 300 quadrats (mainly 50 × 20 m 2 ) that were randomly sampled from the main landuse categories of parklands of village fields (VF), bush fields (BF), sylvopastoral zone (SP) and forest reserves (FR). About 110 tree species were encountered, including 100 indigenous species. The results from balanced species accumulation curves (based on randomized subsampling of the same number of quadrats from each village) showed that the accumulated number of species was smallest in VF, largest in FR and almost equal in BF and SP, whereas classical (unbalanced) species accumulation curves yielded different results. Although there was a significant within-village reduction in species richness with increasing diameter class [averaging 8.5–13.1 more species in the smallest ({\textless}5 cm) compared to the largest diameter class ({\textgreater}80 cm)] for the different landuse categories, new species were also encountered in larger diameter classes (2.7–7.2 species). The evidence for tree regeneration problems (including problems in FR) suggest that farmer-managed tree regeneration should be further explored and that advances in domestication and marketing of indigenous tree species may be crucial to tree conservation in parkland systems.},

abstract = {Wild vegetables (WV) are an important source of food in the maize based subsistence farming sector of rural South Africa. Their main role is as relish as they are used as an accompaniment for staple cereal based diets. They are generally reported to be rich in micronutrients. Although they may be consumed in small quantities, they influence the intake of cereal staples, manage hunger and play a central role in household food security for the poorer rural groups. Mixing severalWV species in one meal contributes to dietary diversity in terms of more vegetable types as well as in terms of choice of relish. For some very poor families WV are substitutes for some food crops. The seasonal oc- currence of these vegetables leaves many families without a food source during the off-season. Wild vegetables increase agro-biodiversity at the household level. This agro- biodiversity helps in buffering against the accumulation and multiplication of pests and diseases and provides im- portant cover for the soil. Further research on agronomic, social and economic dimensions is required to understand the roles of WV in subsistence farming systems in South Africa.},

abstract = {Several studies have recognized that the agriculture sector is one of the major contributor to climate change, as well as largely affected adversely by climate change. Agricultural productivity is known to be sensitive to climate change induced effects and it has impact on livelihood of families linked with farming. Thus it is important to understand what are the existing coping strategies that farmer deploy in case of climate shocks like flood and drought and who is involved in making decision relating to these coping strategies. This paper uses the household level data of 641 households from 12 randomly selected villages in Vaishali district of Bihar to understand the household coping mechanisms with emphasis on role of gender. This study has moved away from the conventional division of households by male and female-headed households and thus capturing the intra-household gender dynamics by understanding the role of men and women within the household as decision makers of the coping strategy to manage climate shock. The study uses a multivariate probit model and the results suggest that there is a higher probability that the male farmers will make the decision on choice of the coping strategy. The most prominent coping mechanism is to find alternative employment in urban locations; however, when consumption levels have to be reduced because of climate shock, all family members then contribute to the decision-making process collectively. The results show that exposure to agriculture extension and training programs have a positive influence on choosing appropriate coping mechanisms, but female farmers have poor access to these resources. These policies should look into providing outreach to both male and female farmers in any given locality.},

abstract = {Ecosystem services can provide a wide range of benefits for human well-being, including provisioning, regulating and cultural services and benefitting both private and public interests in different sectors of society. Biophysical, economic and social factors all make it unlikely that multiple needs will be met simultaneously without deliberate efforts, yet while there is still much interest in developing win-win outcomes there is little understanding of what is required for them to be achieved. We analysed outcomes in a wide range of case studies where ecosystem services had been used for human well-being. Using systematic mapping of the literature from 2000 to 2013, we identified 1324 potentially relevant reports, 92 of which were selected for the review, creating a database of 231 actual or potential recorded trade-offs and synergies. The analysis of these case studies highlighted significant gaps in the literature, including: a limited geographic distribution of case studies, a focus on provisioning as opposed to non-provisioning services and a lack of studies exploring the link between ecosystem service trade-offs or synergies and the ultimate impact on human well-being. Trade-offs are recorded almost three times as often as synergies and the analysis indicates that there are three key indicators of whether or not a trade-off will occur: at least one of the stakeholders having a private interest in the natural resources available, competition between provisioning and non-provisioning ecosystem services and at least one of the stakeholders acting at the local scale. There is not, however, a generalisable context for a win-win, indicating that these trade-off indicators, although highlighting where a trade-off may occur do not indicate that it is inevitable. Taking account of why trade-offs occur (e.g. from failures in management or a lack of accounting for all stakeholders) is more likely to create win-win situations. Consequently, considering the trade-offs, through an awareness of trade-off indicators and the reasons why trade-offs often result, as opposed to attempting to direct a win-win, it may be possible to create the synergies we seek to achieve.},

Observed weather patterns during various stages of pregnancy were also used to examine the effect of temperature and precipitation on birth weight outcomes. In our empirical model we allowed the effect of weather factors to vary by the dominant food production strategy (livelihood zone) in a given region as well as by household wealth, mother's education and birth season. This allowed us to determine if certain populations are more or less vulnerable to unexpected weather changes after adjusting for known covariates. Finally we measured effect size by observing differences in birth weight outcomes in women who have one low birth weight experience and at least one healthy birth weight baby. The results indicated that climate does indeed impact birth weight and at a level comparable, in some cases, to the impact of increasing women's education or household electricity status.},

abstract = {The threat of global climate change has caused concern among scientists because crop production could be severely affected by changes in key climatic variables that could compromise food security both globally and locally. Although it is true that extreme climatic events can severely impact small farmers, available data is just a gross approximation at understanding the heterogeneity of small scale agriculture ignoring the myriad of strategies that thousands of traditional farmers have used and still use to deal with climatic variability. Scientists have now realized that many small farmers cope with and even prepare for climate change, minimizing crop failure through a series of agroecological practices. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to the high level of on-farm biodiversity, a typical feature of traditional farming systems. Based on this evidence, various experts have suggested that rescuing traditional management systems combined with the use of agroecologically based management strategies may represent the only viable and robust path to increase the productivity, sustainability and resilience of peasant-based agricultural production under predicted climate scenarios. In this paper we explore a number of ways in which three key traditional agroecological strategies (biodiversification, soil management and water harvesting) can be implemented in the design and management of agroecosystems allowing farmers to adopt a strategy that both increases resilience and provides economic benefits, including mitigation of global warming. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

This 4 year study examined novel systems in which Alnus acuminata (alnus), Calliandra calothyrsus (calliandra), Sesbania sesban (sesbania) or a mixture of all three were grown on the degraded upper part of bench terraces in Uganda; beans or maize were grown on the more fertile lower terrace during the short and long rains. Three pruning treatments (shoot, root or shoot + root pruning) were applied to the tree rows adjacent to the crops; shoot prunings were applied as green manure to the woodlot from which they came. Pruning increased survival in calliandra and reduced survival in sesbania; alnus was unaffected. Pruning reduced tree height and stem diameter in alnus, but did not affect calliandra or sesbania. Maize yield adjacent to unpruned calliandra, alnus and sesbania or a mixture of all three was reduced by 48, 17, 6 and 24{\%} relative to sole maize. Shoot pruning initially sustained crop performance but shoot + root pruning became necessary when tree age exceeded 2 years; shoot + root pruning increased maize yield by 88, 40, 11 and 31{\%} in the calliandra, alnus, sesbania and tree mixture systems relative to unpruned trees. Bean yield adjacent to unpruned calliandra, alnus, sesbania and the tree mixture was 44, 31, 33 and 22{\%} lower than in sole crops and pruning had no significant effect on crop yield. The results suggest that sesbania fallows may be used on the upper terrace without reducing crop yield on the lower terrace, whereas pruning of alnus is needed to sustain yield. Calliandra woodlots appear to be unsuitable as crop yield was reduced even after pruning.},

While there are many challenges to sharing expertise such as discrimination, academic expectations, siloed thinking, and cultural differences, we identify principles and values that can help food insecurity researchers to improve solutions. These principles are critical consciousness, undoing white privilege, adopting a rights framework, and engaging in co-creation processes. These changes demand a commitment to the following values: acceptance of multiple knowledges, caring relationships, humility, empathy, reciprocity, trust, transparency, accountability, and courage.},

abstract = {This research has the overall objectives of describing the level, trends and differentials of infant and under-five mortality rates in Ethiopia by major background demographic and socio-economic characteristics based on data from the 2000, 2005 and 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys and identifying the major determinants of infant and under-five mortality. A synthetic cohort life table is used to examine levels and trends of childhood mortality and a Cox Regression is applied to assess the associations of child, mother and household characteristics with infant and under-five mortality.   The results from the level and trend analysis indicated that all the five childhood mortality indicators (neonatal, postnatal, infant, child and under-five mortality) have been steadily declining over the last decade in Ethiopia. For instance, the infant mortality rate has declined from 97 deaths per 1000 live births in 2000 to 77 deaths per 1000 live births in 2005, to 59 deaths per 1000 live births in 2011. This is equivalent to 39 per cent reduction from 2000 to 2011. Similarly, under-five mortality has shown a continuous reduction over time; from 166 deaths per 1000 in 2000 to 123 deaths per 1000 in 2005, and to 88 deaths per 1000 in 2011. This is equivalent to a 47 per cent reduction in the level of under-five mortality from the year 2000. However, the contribution of neonatal mortality to infant mortality, both by region and at national level has increased over time.},

abstract = {Cash crops are developing in the once forested areas of Indonesia in parallel with market and economic improvements. Perennial crops such as coffee, cocoa, and rubber were first planted in estates by private or public companies. Local people then integrated these crops into their farming systems, often through the planting of agroforests, that is, intercropping the new cash crop with upland rice and food crops. The crop was generally mixed with fruit trees, timber, and other useful plants. A geographic specialization occurred, driven by biophysical constraints and market opportunities, with expansion of cocoa in Sulawesi, coffee in Lampung, and natural rubber in eastern Sumatra. However, during the past three decades, these agroforests have increasingly been converted into more productive monoculture plantations. A common trajectory can be observed in agricultural landscapes dominated by a perennial cash crop: from ladang to agroforests, and then to monoculture plantations. This process combines agricultural expansion at the expense of natural forests and specialization of the land cover at the expense of biodiversity and wildlife habitats. We determined the main drivers of agricultural expansion and intensification in three regions of Indonesia based on perception surveys and land use profitability analysis. When the national and international contexts clearly influence farmers{\&}rsquo; decisions, local people appear very responsive to economic opportunities. They do not hesitate to change their livelihood system if it can increase their income. Their cultural or sentimental attachment to the forest is not sufficient to prevent forest conversion},

abstract = {Wildlife populations provide harvestable meat to people and contribute to local food security. Throughout the year, and particularly at times of agricultural food shortages, wildlife and other wild foods play a critical role in supporting food security and enhancing local human nutrition. We explored the distribution of food security benefits of agricultural food production and a particular ecosystem provisioning service – wildlife harvest in the Makira Natural Park (MNP) of Madagascar – at community, household and individual levels. We found strong variation in wildlife consumption both among communities and among households and less variation among individuals within households. Mean household wildlife consumption in the target community was 10 kg per year ranging by approximately two orders of magnitude, with poorer and more food insecure households more reliant on wildlife for food. Meats (including wildlife) appeared to be evenly distributed within households, unaffected by age, sex, birth order and body weight, while other foods (including stew, rice and other staples) appeared to be allocated based on body mass. Reductions in wildlife consumption cause increased risk of food insecurity and specific nutritional deficiencies. The findings from our multilevel study suggest that disaggregated analysis that merges ecosystem services theory and the microeconomics of resource allocation allows for a more accurate valuation approach.},

abstract = {Summary Background Anthropogenic declines of animal pollinators and the associated effects on human nutrition are of growing concern. We quantified the nutritional and health outcomes associated with decreased intake of pollinator-dependent foods for populations around the world. Methods We assembled a database of supplies of 224 types of food in 156 countries. We quantified nutrient composition and pollinator dependence of foods to estimate the size of possible reductions in micronutrient and food intakes for different national populations, while keeping calorie intake constant with replacement by staple foods. We estimated pollinator-decline-dependent changes in micronutrient-deficient populations using population-weighted estimated average requirements and the cutpoint method. We estimated disease burdens of non-communicable, communicable, and malnutrition-related diseases with the Global Burden of Disease 2010 comparative risk assessment framework. Findings Assuming complete removal of pollinators, 71 million (95{\%} uncertainty interval 41-262) people in low-income countries could become newly deficient in Vitamin A, and an additional 2{\textperiodcentered}2 billion (1{\textperiodcentered}2-2{\textperiodcentered}5) already consuming below the average requirement would have further declines in Vitamin A supplies. Corresponding estimates for folate were 173 million (134-225) and 1{\textperiodcentered}23 billion (1{\textperiodcentered}12-1{\textperiodcentered}33). A 100{\%} decline in pollinator services could reduce global fruit supplies by 22{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (19{\textperiodcentered}5-26{\textperiodcentered}1), vegetables by 16{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (15{\textperiodcentered}1-17{\textperiodcentered}7), and nuts and seeds by 22{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (17{\textperiodcentered}7-26{\textperiodcentered}4), with significant heterogeneity by country. In sum, these dietary changes could increase global deaths yearly from non-communicable and malnutrition-related diseases by 1{\textperiodcentered}42 million (1{\textperiodcentered}38-1{\textperiodcentered}48) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by 27{\textperiodcentered}0 million (25{\textperiodcentered}8-29{\textperiodcentered}1), an increase of 2{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} for deaths and 1{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} for DALYs. A 50{\%} loss of pollination services would be associated with 700 000 additional annual deaths and 13{\textperiodcentered}2 million DALYs. Interpretation Declines in animal pollinators could cause significant global health burdens from both non-communicable diseases and micronutrient deficiencies.

It discusses in detail the last component, arguing that more food should be produced using sustainable intensification (SI) strategies, and explores the rationale behind, and meaning of, this term.

abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) convened an Expert Committee to reevaluate the use of anthropometry at different ages for assessing health, nutrition, and social wellbeing. The Committee's task included identifying reference data for anthropometric indexes when appropriate, and providing guidelines on how the data should be used. For fetal growth, the Committee recommended an existing sex-specific multiracial reference. In view of the significant technical drawbacks of the current National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO reference and its inadequacy for assessing the growth of breast-fed infants, the Committee recommended the development of a new reference concerning weight and length/height for infants and children, which will be a complex and costly undertaking. Proper interpretation of midupper arm circumference for preschoolers requires age-specific reference data. To evaluate adolescent height-for-age, the Committee recommended the current NCHS/WHO reference. Use of the NCHS body mass index (BMI) data, with their upper percentile elevations and skewness, is undesirable for setting health goals; however, these data were provisionally recommended for defining obesity based on a combination of elevated BMI and high subcutaneous fat. The NCHS values were provisionally recommended as reference data for subscapular and triceps skinfold thicknesses. Guidelines were also provided for adjusting adolescent anthropometric comparisons for maturational status. Currently, there is no need for adult reference data for BMI; interpretation should be based on pragmatic BMI cutoffs. Finally, the Committee noted that few normative anthropometric data exist for the elderly, especially for those {\textgreater} 80 y of age. Proper definitions of health status, function, and biologic age remain to be developed for this group.},

abstract = {Although considerable achievements in the global reduction of hunger and poverty have been made, progress in Africa so far has been very limited. At present, a third of the African population faces widespread hunger and chronic malnutrition and is exposed to a constant threat of acute food crisis and famine. The most affected are rural households whose livelihood is heavily dependent on traditional rainfed agriculture. Rainfall plays a major role in determining agricultural production and hence the economic and social well being of rural communities. The rainfall pattern in sub-Saharan Africa is influenced by large-scale intra-seasonal and inter-annual climate variability including occasional El Ni{\~{n}}o events in the tropical Pacific resulting in frequent extreme weather event such as droughts and floods that reduce agricultural outputs resulting in severe food shortages. Households and communities facing acute food shortages are forced to adopt coping strategies to meet the immediate food requirements of their families. These extreme responses may have adverse long-term impacts on households' ability to have sustainable access to food as well as the environment. The HIV/AIDS crisis has also had adverse impacts on food production activities on the continent.$\backslash$nIn the absence of safety nets and appropriate financial support mechanisms, humanitarian aid is required to enable households effectively cope with emergencies and manage their limited resources more efficiently. Timely and appropriate humanitarian aid will provide households with opportunities to engage in productive and livelihood strategies. Investments in poverty reduction efforts would have better impact if complemented with timely and predictable response mechanisms that would ensure the protection of livelihoods during crisis periods whether weather or conflict-related. With an improved understanding of climate variability including El Ni{\~{n}}o, the implications of weather patterns for the food security and vulnerability of rural communities have become more predictable and can be monitored effectively. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how current advances in the understanding of climate variability, weather patterns and food security could contribute to improved humanitarian decision-making. The paper will propose new approaches for triggering humanitarian responses to weather-induced food crises.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Six Kebeles (the lowest administrative unit in Ethiopia) were sampled from two Districts and 150 households were randomly sampled using proportional-to-size techniques based on the number of farm households in each Kebele. Secondary data were collected from and focus group discussions were conducted with selected individuals. The farmers diversified livelihood activities such as crop and livestock production, collection of NTFPs and off-farm activities. NTFPs played a significant role in household incomes. The contribution from the major NTFPs (forest coffee, honey and spices) accounted for 47{\%} of annual household income. The role of NTFPs was influenced by a number of factors. Variables including being native to the area (+), total land holding (+), possession of livestock (+) and access to extension (+) significantly affected forest coffee production. Age of household head (-), land holding (+) and distance of the market from the residence (-) significantly affected honey production. Size of landholding (+), distance to market (-) and distance of the forest from the residence (-) were significant variables determining the NTFP incomes derived by the households. Attention is needed in the design of policies and strategies for the well-being of households to the contribution of NTFPs to local incomes and the variables that affect the collection of NTFPs must be considered. ¬{\textcopyright} 2014 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {There is general consensus that the impacts of climate change on agriculture will add significantly to the development challenges of ensuring food security and reducing poverty, particularly in Africa. While these changes will influence agriculture at a broad scale, regional or country-level assessments can miss critical detail. We use high-resolution methods to generate characteristic daily weather data for a combination of different future emission scenarios and climate models to drive detailed simulation models of the maize and bean crops. For the East African region, there is considerable spatial and temporal variation in this crop response. We evaluate the response of maize and beans to a changing climate, as a prelude to detailed targeting of options that can help smallholder households adapt. The results argue strongly against the idea of large, spatially contiguous development domains for identifying and implementing adaptation options, particularly in regions with large variations in topography and current average temperatures.

abstract = {With the continuous growth of internet usage, Google Trends has emerged as a source of information to investigate how social trends evolve over time. Knowing how the level of interest in conservation topics-approximated using Google search volume-varies over time can help support targeted conservation science communication. However, the evolution of search volume over time and the mechanisms that drive peaks in searches are poorly understood. We conducted time series analyses on Google search data from 2004 to 2013 to investigate: (i) whether interests in selected conservation topics have declined and (ii) the effect of news reporting and academic publishing on search volume. Although trends were sensitive to the term used as benchmark, we did not find that public interest towards conservation topics such as climate change, ecosystem services, deforestation, orangutan, invasive species and habitat loss was declining. We found, however, a robust downward trend for endangered species and an upward trend for ecosystem services. The quantity of news articles was related to patterns in Google search volume, whereas the number of research articles was not a good predictor but lagged behind Google search volume, indicating the role of news in the transfer of conservation science to the public.},

A ubiquitous increase in estimates of potential evapotranspiration (PET), driven by atmospheric warming11 , underlies the drying trends4,8,9,12 , but may be a methodological artefact5 . Here we show that the PET estimator commonly used (the Penman–Monteith PET13 for either an open-water surface1,2,6,7,12 or a reference crop3,4,8,9,11 ) severely overpredicts the changes in non-water- stressed evapotranspiration computed in the climate models themselvesinACCexperiments.Thisoverpredictionispartially due to neglect of stomatal conductance reductions commonly induced by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations in climate models5 .

abstract = {An increasing amount of information is being collected on the ecological and socio-economic value of goods and services provided by natural and semi-natural ecosystems. However, much of this information appears scattered throughout a disciplinary academic literature, unpublished government agency reports, and across the World Wide Web. In addition, data on ecosystem goods and services often appears at incompatible scales of analysis and is classified differently by different authors. In order to make comparative ecological economic analysis possible, a standardized framework for the comprehensive assessment of ecosystem functions, goods and services is needed. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a conceptual framework and typology for describing, classifying and valuing ecosystem functions, goods and services in a clear and consistent manner. In the following analysis, a classification is given for the fullest possible range of 23 ecosystem functions that provide a much larger number of goods and services. In the second part of the paper, a checklist and matrix is provided, linking these ecosystem functions to the main ecological, socio-cultural and economic valuation methods. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The main objectives of this report are: 1) to describe the procedures and questions used to collect data on NCDs in DHS surveys; 2) to present prevalence rates and differentials of hypertension and diabetes; 3) to compare NCD data collection efforts of DHS and WHO; and 4) to discuss future NCD data collection by DHS. Twenty-five DHS countries were identified as having one or more surveys that collected biomarker or self-reported data on at least one of the following NCDs: hypertension, diabetes, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer. Most of the NCD data collected in the 39 surveys examined in this report are self-reported data. Biomarker data are available only for hypertension and diabetes in 13 countries and 3 countries, respectively. Age ranges of respondents eligible for biomarker testing varied across surveys. While earlier surveys focused on respondents in DHS standard age ranges (15-49 for women and 15-54(59) for men), recent surveys were designed to collect biomarker data on older adults. Procedures used in collecting biomarker measurements in DHS surveys are largely consistent and follow WHO guidelines. The analysis results suggest large disparities in prevalence rates of hypertension and diabetes across DHS countries by age, wealth, education, and residence. The report concludes that DHS has made a substantial contribution to understanding the issue of NCDs in developing countries by collecting data on several important NCDs. However, the expansion of NCD data collection must necessarily be judged by weighing increased cost against the potential utility of the data. Systematic data collection on NDCs may be more relevant in middle-income countries than in low-income countries.  },

abstract = {Encroachment of woody plants into grasslands has generated considerable interest among ecologists. Syntheses of encroachment effects on ecosystem processes have been limited in extent and confined largely to pastoral land uses or particular geographical regions. We used univariate analyses, meta-analysis and structural equation modelling to test the propositions that (1) shrub encroachment does not necessarily lead to declines in ecosystem functions and (2) shrub traits influence the functional outcome of encroachment. Analyses of 43 ecosystem attributes from 244 case studies worldwide showed that some attributes consistently increased with encroachment (e.g. soil C, N), and others declined (e.g. grass cover, pH), but most exhibited variable responses. Traits of shrubs were associated with significant, though weak, structural and functional outcomes of encroachment. Our review revealed that encroachment had mixed effects on ecosystem structure and functioning at global scales, and that shrub traits influence the functional outcome of encroachment. Thus, a simple designation of encroachment as a process leading to functionally, structurally or contextually degraded ecosystems is not supported by a critical analysis of existing literature. Our results highlight that the commonly established link between shrub encroachment and degradation is not universal. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS and State Government of NSW.},

abstract = {Data are presented indicating a seasonal mosaic pattern of burning in the savanna of southern Mali. A seasonal mosaic is a landscape that is annually re-created by people, and which contains patches of unburned, early burned, and recently burned vegetation. A survey of over 100 farmers and in-depth interviews demonstrates that rural inhabitants of southern Mali begin an annual burning regime early in the dry season in order to fragment the landscape, with the goal of preventing later fires that can damage natural resources. The process of gradually burning off the driest vegetation creates a seasonal mosaic of habitat patches that increases the potential of the landscape for a variety of dry season land uses, including hunting, gathering of savanna products, and grazing. An analysis of a series of Landsat images shows that the practice of mosaic burning is widespread in the wooded savanna, in which burning usually begins early and large fires are rare. On the basis of recent developments in ecological theory and empirical evidence from similar burning regimes in parts of Australia, it is suggested that seasonal mosaic burning in Mali not only prevents damaging late-season fires but increases biodiversity. It is concluded that discourse on African savanna burning overemphasizes the ecologically detrimental aspects of fire, while neglecting the beneficial ones resulting in misguided policies that pose a threat to human livelihoods and savanna ecosystems.},

abstract = {Over the past 30 years, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program has conducted more than 300 household surveys in over 90 countries. As the number of countries with multiple surveys has risen, there is an increased opportunity for comparisons of health in relation to economic status over time. However, the DHS Wealth Index, which ranks relative economic standing among surveyed households, is computed separately for each survey. Existing approaches to make the DHS Wealth Index comparable across surveys appear to encounter problems when comparing early DHS surveys to later DHS surveys; the latter frequently contain triple the number of questions related to wealth than earlier surveys. This study focuses on the particular challenge of conducting intertemporal analysis using DHS data from the mid-1990s to the present. It demonstrates how to generate a Harmonized Wealth Index (HWI) based on common assets and services across surveys.  In eight focal countries?Bangladesh, Bolivia, Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Nepal, and Zimbabwe?we use pooled household data to compute an HWI. Results show that the HWI is highly correlated with the existing DHS Wealth Index. Loss of information due to asset harmonization compresses the index, but this occurs primarily toward the top of the distribution in the most recent survey; except for Bolivia in 1998 and Ghana in 2008, the HWI appears to perform well at differentiating gradations of poverty. Overall, the HWI approach is a promising avenue for analysts and policymakers interested in intertemporal comparisons of health and poverty in specific countries. },

Several measures of preferences are used: the ideal number of children, the proportion of women who want no more children, the planning status of recent births, and the wanted total fertility rate. For 35 countries that have conducted more than one survey, trends in preferences have been documented. And, for a subset of mostly sub-Saharan African countries, men?s reproductive attitudes are also described.  In general, the number of children desired is declining in most Asian and Latin American countries. There is also evidence of a desire for smaller families in southern and eastern Africa but little change in the preference for large families is evident in western and middle Africa. Unwanted fertility is highest in the countries of northern Africa and western Asia as well as in Latin America; unwanted births are still uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in western and middle Africa. A comparison of wanted fertility rates with recent actual fertility shows a potential for further declines in fertility and impending replacement levels in many Asian and Latin American populations. Men?s reproductive preferences in Africa tend to be higher than those of women and are also higher in polygynous marriages.

abstract = {Q1 What is the Voices of the Hungry Project? A1 FAO launched the Voices of the Hungry (VOH) project in 2013 to provide up-to-date information about food insecurity that is policy-relevant and actionable. The project developed a methodology to measure the severity of food insecurity as experienced by individuals or households in a way that is comparable across countries 1 . Drawing on similar tools in the USA and Latin America, the project developed the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) and innovative analytic methods aiming to provide a new global standard for measuring food insecurity (access) that is valid, endorsed at the international level, and used for global and country monitoring. Peer review of the methodology by a group of distinguished experts and National Statistics Offices in 2015 affirmed the scientific validity of the approach to produce national estimates of moderate and severe food insecurity that are comparable across countries. For world-wide application of the FIES, VOH leverages on the Gallup World Poll{\textregistered} (GWP), a branch of Gallup, Inc. that has conducted nationally representative surveys in more than 140 countries annually since 2005. Beginning in 2014, FAO contracted Gallup to collect data using the FIES in the World Poll questionnaire.

Among the HIV-related knowledge outcomes studied, the largest percentage of HIV-positive men and women are aware of HIV prevention methods and the lowest percentage is for comprehensive knowledge about AIDS. There has been significant improvement, however, in comprehensive knowledge about AIDS and knowledge of PMTCT in countries studied with recent trend data.  Overall, there is a strong association between educational attainment and comprehensive knowledge about AIDS among HIV-positive men and women. Women?s education is also positively associated with their knowledge of PMTCT in most countries studied, but not so for men. Over time, prevalence of multiple partnership and higher-risk sex has remained about the same in all five countries studied with data from two surveys. While condom use at last sex has more than doubled in most cases, a large proportion of PLHIV are sexually active and have unprotected sex. Prior HIV testing is common and the testing rates are higher for women than men. Rates of testing and receiving results have increased substantially for both women and men. Contrary to expectations, the study found that engaging in sexual risk behaviors, such as having multiple sexual partners, is not associated with HIV testing uptake. },

For wasting, we assess children under 59 months of age and relate growth to NDVI averages for the current and most recent growing periods. Correlations between short-run indicators of child growth and intensity of green vegetation are generally positive. Regressions that control for a range of child-, mother- and household-specific characteristics produce mixed evidence regarding the role of NDVI anomalies during critical periods in a child's early life and the subsequent probability of stunting and wasting.

Women of reproductive age and children experience devastating health consequences as a result of limited resources, cultural influences, and biological vulnerabilities. Undernutrition and infectious diseases exist in a baleful synergy: undernutrition reduces immunological capacity to defend against diseases, and diseases deplete and deprive the body of essential nutrients. Undernutrition and infectious diseases further exacerbate poverty through lost wages, increased health care costs, and—most insidiously—impaired intellectual development that can significantly reduce earning potential. Health experts have recently recognized the long-term effects of early undernutrition and inadequate infant feeding for obesity and chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

The visitation rates of these pollinators to eggplant flowers declined significantly with distance from the wild habitat. The importance of wild plants as alternative forage source for pollinators was assessed by a survey of the flowering plants in different habitats surrounding eggplant fields. While ruderal farm weeds provide much of these resources, the Acacia tortilis riverine forest experienced high visitation rates in one critical period of the dry season. The spatio-temporal foraging behaviour of eggplant pollinators highlights the role of the agricultural matrix in conserving ecosystem services.

abstract = {Maternal and child undernutrition is highly prevalent in low-income and middle-income countries, resulting in substantial increases in mortality and overall disease burden. In this paper, we present new analyses to estimate the effects of the risks related to measures of undernutrition, as well as to suboptimum breastfeeding practices on mortality and disease. We estimated that stunting, severe wasting, and intrauterine growth restriction together were responsible for 2??2 million deaths and 21{\%} of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for children younger than 5 years. Deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc were estimated to be responsible for 0??6 million and 0??4 million deaths, respectively, and a combined 9{\%} of global childhood DALYs. Iron and iodine deficiencies resulted in few child deaths, and combined were responsible for about 0??2{\%} of global childhood DALYs. Iron deficiency as a risk factor for maternal mortality added 115 000 deaths and 0??4{\%} of global total DALYs. Suboptimum breastfeeding was estimated to be responsible for 1??4 million child deaths and 44 million DALYs (10{\%} of DALYs in children younger than 5 years). In an analysis that accounted for co-exposure of these nutrition-related factors, they were together responsible for about 35{\%} of child deaths and 11{\%} of the total global disease burden. The high mortality and disease burden resulting from these nutrition-related factors make a compelling case for the urgent implementation of interventions to reduce their occurrence or ameliorate their consequences. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Satellite‐observed night lights are used to identify measurement stations located in extreme darkness and adjust temperature trends of urban and periurban stations for nonclimatic factors, verifying that urban effects on analyzed global change are small. Because the GISS analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements, we test alternative choices for the ocean data, showing that global temperature change is sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions where observations are limited. We use simple 12 month (and n × 12) running means to improve the information content in our temperature graphs. Contrary to a popular misconception, the rate of warming has not declined. Global temperature is rising as fast in the past decade as in the prior 2 decades, despite year‐to‐year fluctuations associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o‐La Ni{\~{n}}a cycle of tropical ocean temperature.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global climate change is anticipated to reduce future cereal yields and threaten food security, thus potentially increasing the risk of undernutrition. The causation of undernutrition is complex, and there is a need to develop models that better quantify the potential impacts of climate change on population health.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: We developed a model for estimating future undernutrition that accounts for food and nonfood (socioeconomic) causes and can be linked to available regional scenario data. We estimated child stunting attributable to climate change in five regions in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2050.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used current national food availability and undernutrition data to parameterize and validate a global model, using a process-driven approach based on estimations of the physiological relationship between a lack of food and stunting. We estimated stunting in 2050 using published modeled national calorie availability under two climate scenarios and a reference scenario (no climate change).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We estimated that climate change will lead to a relative increase in moderate stunting of 1-29{\%} in 2050 compared with a future without climate change. Climate change will have a greater impact on rates of severe stunting, which we estimated will increase by 23{\%} (central SSA) to 62{\%} (South Asia).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Climate change is likely to impair future efforts to reduce child malnutrition in South Asia and SSA, even when economic growth is taken into account. Our model suggests that to reduce and prevent future undernutrition, it is necessary to both increase food access and improve socioeconomic conditions, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions.},

We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors - agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor - increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2{\%} of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20{\%} of county income (90{\%} chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).},

abstract = {The development of the DHS Wealth Index more than a decade ago provided the opportunity to analyze economic status inequalities beyond those of educational attainment, occupation, residence, and ethnic group. However, the DHS wealth index is survey-specific and as such refers to a particular point in time, limiting comparative and trend analyses involving economic status. This report describes the methodology of the Comparative Wealth Index (CWI), a way to make the standard DHS Wealth Index comparable across surveys and time which allows direct comparison of economic status levels. In the report CWI has been computed for 172 DHS surveys conducted between 1990 and 2012. Calculations of means and standard deviations of the CWI for each survey show that the CWI comports well with per capita income measures for countries and for regions. The report illustrates use of the CWI in analyses of indicators of child mortality, fertility, maternal health care, and child nutritional status and highlights the importance of considering absolute levels of wealth when comparing national survey data. The Comparative Wealth Index does not replace the original DHS Wealth Index but adds an additional dimension for comparative and trend analysis, one that can be used to sort out the effects of health programs from the effects of changes in economic status of the population. },

WPE has important consequences for ecosystem functioning, global carbon balances and human economies. Here we report, using high-resolution satellite imagery, that woody vegetation cover over sub-Saharan Africa increased by 8{\%} over the past three decades and that a diversity of drivers, other than CO2, were able to explain 78{\%} of the spatial variation in this trend. A decline in burned area along with warmer, wetter climates drove WPE, although this has been mitigated in areas with high population growth rates, and high and low extremes of herbivory, specifically browsers. These results confirm global greening trends, thereby bringing into question widely held theories about declining terrestrial carbon balances and desert expansion. Importantly, while global drivers such as climate and CO2 may enhance the risk of WPE, managing fire and herbivory at the local scale provides tools to mitigate continental WPE.},

Additionally, we find strong evidence of observed and unobserved heterogeneity, which affects both the choice of fertilizer amounts and the marginal returns to fertilizer use.

abstract = {Forests provide many benefits (e.g., esthetics, water purification, habitat, carbon sequestration) to humans when they are conserved. However, forest conservation efforts may conflict with other uses, particularly timber harvest. Incentives for forest conservation can be established through payment for ecosystem services (PES) policies. PES policies rely on forest valuation studies which traditionally have valued the whole forest, or characteristics of a forest. Methods that allow variability in estimated forest values over space can provide valuation information at a finer scale and aid in the optimization of PES policies. These spatially explicit values provide information critical to many policy decisions, particularly conservation prioritization and planning.Using moderate resolution satellite remote sensing (i.e., LandSat) and a forest use survey conducted in Kam Cha i, Thailand, methods to estimate forest product valuation for spatially heterogeneous plots are demonstrated. These estimates are produced using geographic information system (GIS) multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). The MCDA method combines forest use data with associated travel costs and vegetation cover estimates to provide spatially explicit estimates of forest values. This information is then used to compare local use values against potential carbon credit values estimated from the literature. The results show that a majority of the forest plots have higher PES values than for local forest products. Some do not, however, which suggests a possible cause for resistance against potential PES policies implemented in these areas.},

This study examines the effect of weather variability (shock) occurring up to three planting and growing season prior on per capita monthly household expenditure in rural Tanzania, Uganda, and Ghana. The analyses combine monthly temperature (1950–2013) and precipitation (1981–2013) data with data from several rounds of household surveys conducted between 1998 and 2013. Substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity is documented in the incidence of shocks, with effects dependent on both the study and lag period considered. Analysis of short panel data shows the cumulative effect of above-average precipitation on expenditure to be negative in Uganda -while positive in Tanzania-, but the relationship does not persist when pooling survey data spanning over a decade. The evidence from pooled data suggests a positive association between above-average temperature (heat wave) and expenditure in (historically cooler) Uganda, with the opposite effect observed in (the relatively warmer) Tanzania. For Ghana, the association between heat wave and expenditure is positive. There is no evidence of heterogeneous effects along several dimensions, except by agro-ecological condition. Further research into the effects of shocks on more direct outcomes–such as agricultural practices, yields, and dietary intake–is therefore recommended to shed light on possible impact pathways and appropriate localized adaptation strategies.},

This study seeks to find what the predictors of IPTp uptake are among pregnant women who gave birth in the 24 months preceding the 2010-2011 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS). The study compared uptake of IPTp  nationally and in the IPTp targeted districts. IPTp targeted districts are the malaria zones in Zimbabwe, mainly districts bordering Mozambique and Zambia.  Methods: The study consisted of secondary analysis of the 2010-2011 ZDHS data. The study population was all women age 15-49 who had a live birth in the two years preceding the survey and had at least one antenatal care (ANC) visit.  Results: The proportion of women who had at least one IPTp dose in the national sample was significantly lower, at 15{\%}, than in the IPTp targeted districts (p {\textless} 0.001), at 24{\%}. In multivariate analysis, women?s age group and gestational age at first ANC visit were statistically significant in predicting uptake of two or more IPTp doses nationally, while in the IPTp target districts no factor was significantly associated with receiving two or more doses.  Conclusions: The majority of pregnant women who gave birth in the two years preceding the survey did not receive SP for the prevention of malaria complication during pregnancy. There is a need for health education among women and communities on the importance of IPTp, and a need to book pregnancies early in the first trimester, inclusive of pregnant primigravidae mothers, to improve chances of pregnant women getting the recommended IPTp doses during pregnancy.},

abstract = {The influence of dispersed trees on microclimatic conditions, gas exchange and productivity of maize (Zea mays L.) in a Grevillea robusta-based agroforestry system in semi-arid Kenya was examined to test the hypothesis that the benefits of shade seen in savannah ecosystems may be outweighed by competition for below-ground resources. Meristem temperature, cumulative thermal time, intercepted radiation, spatial distribution of shade and gas exchange were determined for maize grown as sole crops, in an agroforestry system, or under shade nets providing 25 or 50{\%} reductions in incident radiation to discriminate between effects of shade and below-ground competition. The major benefit of shade was to reduce exposure to the supra-optimal temperatures experienced in many tropical regions, and which are predicted to become increasingly common by climate change models. However, although trees decreased photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) incident on understorey maize by ca. 30{\%}, the yield reduction was much greater than in the 25{\%} shade net treatment in four seasons providing contrasting rainfall. Maize yield was unaffected by 50{\%} artificial shade in the driest season (168 mm) but decreased with increasing shade when rainfall was high (628 mm). Shade reduced meristem temperature and delayed flowering by 5-24 days depending on treatment and seasonal rainfall. Thermal time to flowering in the agroforestry system doubled from 600 to 1200 °C day as rainfall decreased. Photosynthetic and transpiration rates for understorey maize were similar to the 25 and 50{\%} shade treatments when rainfall was high, but were ca. 10{\%} of those for unshaded sole maize in dry seasons. PPFD-saturated photosynthetic rate was initially similar in all treatments but fell sharply in the agroforestry system as the season progressed. Radiation conversion coefficients did not differ between unshaded sole and understorey maize. The results suggest that the ameliorative influence of tree shade was greater in low rainfall seasons, as in savannah systems, but that potential benefits were outweighed by below-ground competition. This may be managed by root-pruning trees. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The mortality estimates are based on data from 102 Demographic and Health Surveys carried out between 1990 and 2002. Differentials are compared for key variables that are known to influence childhood mortality.  In all regions except sub-Saharan Africa the vast majority of deaths among children under five years occur in the first year of life. In sub-Saharan Africa, large numbers of children also die between the age of one and four?the age range with potentially the most preventable childhood deaths.  Estimates of childhood mortality for the five years preceding the survey are presented for the most recent surveys. The results show that under-five mortality ranges from 25 deaths per 1,000 live births in Turkey to 274 per 1,000 in Niger. The results indicate that children of women who have births in quick succession, at young ages, or at high birth orders, have poorer child survival outcomes. Male births and multiple births are also at increased risk of dying because of increased biological risks. In almost all countries, children of women with less education or who live in rural areas have higher levels of mortality than children of other women.  Trend data on childhood mortality suggest that under-five mortality has been declining in most of the countries in Asia and Latin America. At the same time, past improvements in child survival in much of sub-Saharan Africa are being reversed. },

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether there is a relationship between male involvement in maternal health and utilization of skilled birth attendants (SBAs) after controlling for socio-demographic and maternal characteristics.  Design: Data from the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey(KDHS) conducted in 2008?09 were analyzed. We fitted an unadjusted logistic regression model and, to control for confounders, an adjusted binary logistic regression model to look for associations between utilization of an SBA, on one hand, and, on the other, socio-demographic characteristics of the woman, male perceptions about maternal health, and male attendance at an antenatal care (ANC) visit.  Setting: Nationally representative survey in Kenya.  Subjects: The unit of analysis was couples who met the inclusion criteria of being married and having had a child in the three years before the survey. To ensure that the couples were reporting on the same child, we picked couples who gave the same age for their last child. The final weighted sample size was 730 couples.  Results: The adjusted odds ratio after controlling for other factors indicates that women whose husbands attended at least one ANC visit were more likely to have skilled birth attendance than those whose husbands did not attend any ANC visits [AOR, 1.9; 95 percent CI, 1.09-3.32]. Maternal characteristics that had a statistically significant association with delivery by an SBA included educational level, employment, number of ANC visits, and parity. The province where the couple resided also was statistically significant.  Conclusion: In Kenya a male partner?s participation, through attending ANC visits, is associated with a woman?s use of an SBA during delivery.},

abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyze the impact of development interventions on the population of three Nigerien villages that differ in terms of their agro-ecological, social and economic characteristics. This is performed by simulating the behavior of individuals in an agent-based modeling framework which integrates the village characteristics as well as the family internal rules that condition access to economic and production activities. Villagers are differentiated according to the social and agro-ecological constraints they are subjected to. Two development project interventions are simulated, assuming no land scarcity: increasing the availability of inorganic fertilizers for farmers and an inventory credit technique based on millet grain. Two distinct approaches were used to model the rationale of farmers' decision making: gains or losses in economic value or gains or losses in within-village "reputation" Our results show that village populations do not respond en masse to development interventions. Reputation has little effect on the population behavior and should be considered more as a local proxy for wealth amongst villagers, suggesting the monetization of these societies. Populations involve themselves in the two simulated development interventions only at sites where savings are possible. Some level of household food security and investment capacity is actually required to take part in the development interventions, which are largely conditioned by family manpower and size. As long as uncultivated land remains available in the village territory, support for inorganic fertilizers has little impact in the absence of any intensification process. Inventory credit engages a maximum of 25{\%} of the population at the site with medium agro-ecological conditions. Therefore, both interventions should be viewed as a potential support tool for a limited part of the population capable of going beyond the survival level, but not as a generic poverty-alleviation panacea. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES We sought to obtain evidence about the scope of women's empowerment and the mechanisms underlying the significant reduction in intimate partner violence documented by the Intervention With Microfinance for AIDS and Gender Equity (IMAGE) cluster-randomized trial in rural South Africa. METHODS The IMAGE intervention combined a microfinance program with participatory training on understanding HIV infection, gender norms, domestic violence, and sexuality. Outcome measures included past year's experience of intimate partner violence and 9 indicators of women's empowerment. Qualitative data about changes occurring within intimate relationships, loan groups, and the community were also collected. RESULTS After 2 years, the risk of past-year physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner was reduced by more than half (adjusted risk ratio=0.45; 95{\%} confidence interval=0.23, 0.91). Improvements in all 9 indicators of empowerment were observed. Reductions in violence resulted from a range of responses enabling women to challenge the acceptability of violence, expect and receive better treatment from partners, leave abusive relationships, and raise public awareness about intimate partner violence. CONCLUSIONS Our findings, both qualitative and quantitative, indicate that economic and social empowerment of women can contribute to reductions in intimate partner violence.},

abstract = {Perspective From 1703 onward, the annual rise and fall of measles deaths in London was recorded in sufficient detail to allow for careful mathematical modeling in 1918 (1). Since then, surveillance for a variety of diseases has established that regular seasonal variation in incidence is the rule, rather than the exception, for acute infections. Seasonal variations should be distinguished from periodic large epidemics, as observed every 2 years for measles (2) or at less frequent and more irregular intervals for meningococcal meningitis (3) and rubella (4). This discussion will focus on the more robust annual cycle, which " locks in " large epidemics to the same time of year (3,4) and persists even after large epidemics have been eliminated by mass vaccination (2). The life cycles of pathogens spread by insect vectors or maintained in animal or environmental reservoirs add complexity because seasonal changes might influence not only the pathogen or human host but also the vector population and animal or environmental reservoir. Therefore, this discussion will focus on bacterial and viral pathogens maintained primarily by person-to-person spread. The regular and predictable pattern of seasonal outbreaks dominates the epidemiology of many exclusively human pathogens (Figure 1). Different infections peak in each of the four seasons, but for each pathogen, the timing and characteristics of the annual outbreak are remarkably consistent from year to year. Other key observations have been made on the seasonality of infectious diseases, including the simultaneous onset of outbreaks in geographically remote areas and the persistence of pathogens in the off-season in the absence of epidemic spread (Table). In fact, latitude has a clear influence on the timing and magnitude of outbreaks of rotavirus infection (10), influenza (15), and poliomyelitis Seasonal cycles of infectious diseases have been variously attributed to changes in atmospheric conditions, the prevalence or virulence of the pathogen, or the behavior of the host. Some observations about seasonality are difficult to reconcile with these explanations. These include the simultaneous appearance of outbreaks across widespread geographic regions of the same latitude; the detection of pathogens in the off-season without epidemic spread; and the consistency of seasonal changes, despite wide variations in weather and human behavior. In contrast, an increase in susceptibility of the host population, perhaps linked to the annual light/dark cycle and mediated by the pattern of melatonin secretion, might account for many heretofore unexplained features of infectious disease seasonality. Ample evidence indicates that photoperiod-driven physiologic changes are typical in mammalian species, including some in humans. If such physiologic changes underlie human resistance to infectious diseases for large portions of the year and the changes can be identified and modified, the therapeutic and preventive implications may be considerable.},

abstract = {Parameters of interest in estimating model-based projections of HIV prevalence include HIV incidence patterns by age, which we express as HIV incidence in an age group relative to HIV incidence in age 25-29. Questions of interest include, are these age patterns similar or significantly different across countries with generalized HIV epidemics, and if different, are there any age-based behavioral variables that explain those differences? As incidence cannot be measured directly, this study seeks to address these questions using HIV prevalence patterns from 28 DHS datasets covering 19 countries with generalized HIV epidemic.This analysis finds that an average pattern of HIV prevalence by age generally matches the country-specific patterns. In some cases, however, mostly in older age groups and in a few cases in the younger age groups, the HIV prevalence pattern differs significantly from the average pattern. The analysis identifies years since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and maturity of the HIV epidemic as significantly correlated with HIV prevalence pattern for women and men in older age groups, and the proportion sexually active or proportion with condom use as factors among young women that are significantly correlated with HIV prevalence pattern. The significance of ART as a factor in particular points to the need for continuing to identify changes in HIV prevalence patterns over time, especially as access to ART may not be similar across all age groups. },

abstract = {According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, common indicators are needed to monitor the loss of biodiversity and the implications for the sustainable provision of ecosystem services. However, a variety of indicators are already being used resulting in many, mostly incompatible, monitoring systems. In order to synthesise the different indicator approaches and to detect gaps in the development of common indicator systems, we examined 531 indicators that have been reported in 617 peer-reviewed journal articles between 1997 and 2007. Special emphasis was placed on comparing indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services across ecosystems (forests, grass- and shrublands, wetlands, rivers, lakes, soils and agro-ecosystems) and spatial scales (from patch to global scale). The application of biological indicators was found most often focused on regional and finer spatial scales with few indicators applied across ecosystem types. Abiotic indicators, such as physico-chemical parameters and measures of area and fragmentation, are most frequently used at broader (regional to continental) scales. Despite its multiple dimensions, biodiversity is usually equated with species richness only. The functional, structural and genetic components of biodiversity are poorly addressed despite their potential value across habitats and scales. Ecosystem service indicators are mostly used to estimate regulating and supporting services but generally differ between ecosystem types as they reflect ecosystem-specific services. Despite great effort to develop indicator systems over the past decade, there is still a considerable gap in the widespread use of indicators for many of the multiple components of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and a need to develop common monitoring schemes within and across habitats. Filling these gaps is a prerequisite for linking biodiversity dynamics with ecosystem service delivery and to achieving the goals of global and sub-global initiatives to halt the loss of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Zimbabwe has a high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) burden. It is therefore important to scale up HIV testing and counselling (HTC) as a gateway to HIV prevention, treatment and care. The objective of this study is to determine factors associated with HIV testing uptake among adult men and women in Zimbabwe.   The study used data from 7,313 women and 6,584 men who completed interviewer-administered questionnaires and who provided blood specimens for HIV testing during the 2010-11 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS). Associations between socio-demographic and sexual risk behaviours were examined using the Chi-square test for association and multivariate logistic regression.  The study found that more women than men were ever tested for HIV (61{\%} versus 39{\%}), which was similar to findings for testing in the 12 months before the survey (40{\%} versus 26{\%}). In the multivariate analysis, women who visited antenatal care (ANC) had significantly higher testing uptake, and men whose partners attended ANC in the past two years had a significantly higher testing uptake. For men, testing uptake increased with increasing age from age 20, and was particularly high for men age 45-49, while, for women testing was highest at age 20-29. Other significant factors for HIV testing among both women and men were educational attainment, high wealth status, currently/formerly being in union and being HIV-infected. Despite higher testing levels among those found to be HIV-infected, 26{\%} of women and 45{\%} of men were never tested for HIV.  ANC is an important gateway for HIV testing among pregnant women, and this model can be extended to their partners. Strategies aimed at generally increasing HIV testing uptake need to be adopted, particularly for men and for lower-income and less educated populations. The high proportion of undiagnosed individuals highlights the need for continued scale-up of HIV testing in Zimbabwe.},

The findings indicate that adolescent pregnancy is more common in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean than in South/Southeast Asia when considering surveys where all women are interviewed, regardless of marital status. In all regions, knowledge of any method of contraception is high among young women and nearly universal among young men. Young men are less likely to practice primary abstinence than young women.  In addition, multiple sexual partnerships and engaging in higher-risk sex are much more common among young men than young women.

This study examines levels and trends in contraceptive switching, contraceptive failure, and abandonment of contraception while still in need of pregnancy prevention. Data come from the two most recent Demographic and Health Surveys in Armenia, Bangladesh, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya, and Zimbabwe. Results show that contraceptive discontinuation in the first year of use is common (18 to 63 percent across countries), and that the majority of these discontinuations are among women who are still in need of contraception: between 12 and 47 percent of women stop using contraception within one year even though they do not want to become pregnant. We found discontinuation to be strongly associated with the type of contraceptive method used. Additionally, age, parity, education, partner?s desired fertility, community-level contraceptive prevalence, and the region in which women live were all associated with contraceptive switching, failure, or discontinuing while still in need of contraception. In summary, rates of contraceptive discontinuation, even among women who want to avoid pregnancy, remain high and are increasing in some countries where family planning efforts have decreased. This contraceptive discontinuation study, along with future research in this area, can help policymakers and program managers track family planning progress and refocus efforts to meet the goal of reproductive health for all. },

For many indigenous peoples, the contributions of wild edible plants go well beyond nourishment; they are often also used as dye and medicines, as well as markers of identity. However, historical and contemporary processes of land grabbing, forest loss, acculturation, and lifestyle changes may Erode the transmission of plant knowledge to new generations. In this paper, we document 1) the botanical knowledge of wild edible plants and 2) perceived influences on the transmission of this knowledge to younger generations in a Mapuche community in Andean temperate forests, Chile. Thirty-seven people participated in this study. We conducted participant observation, freelists, and informal, photo-elicitation, and semi-structured interviews. A total of 47 wild edibles were recorded (42 plants were determined to species level by participants). Dig{\"{u}}e{\~{n}}e (Cyttaria espinosae; Smith's Index of Saliency, S = 0.82) was the most salient wild edible, followed by changle (Ramaria flava, S = 0.68), maqui (Aristotelia chilensis, S = 0.67), murra (Rubus ulmifolius, S = 0.59), and pi{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n (Araucaria araucana, S = 0.56). Participants provided detailed information on species seasonality, ecology, and changes in availability over time. Most adult women and elders had a comprehensive knowledge of wild edibles. However, younger generations were not learning what the elders had once learned. The lack of access to forests and the formal school regime were reported as the main factors interrupting the transmission of knowledge. Because Mapuche pedagogy is oral and in situ, land loss and the school regime have left younger generations with few opportunities to engage in these forms of indigenous pedagogy.},

The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a probability index that was developed to give a better representation of abnormal wetness and dryness than the Palmer indices. Before the user community will accept the SPI as an alternative to the Palmer indices, a standard method must be developed for computing the index. Standardization is necessary so that all users of the index will have a common basis for both spatial and temporal comparison of index values. If different probability distributions and models are used to describe an observed series of precipitation, then different SPI values may be obtained. This article describes the effect on the SPI values computed from different probability models as well as the effects on dry event characteristics. It is concluded that the Pearson Type III distribution is the best universal model, and that the reliability of the SPI is sample size dependent. It is also concluded that because of data limitations, SPIs with time scales longer than 24 months may be unreliable. An internet link is provided that will allow users to access Fortran 77 source code for calculating the SPI.},

abstract = {Food production requires application of fertilizers containing phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium on agricultural fields in order to sustain crop yields. However modern agriculture is dependent on phosphorus derived from phosphate rock, which is a non-renewable resource and current global reserves may be depleted in 50-100 years. While phosphorus demand is projected to increase, the expected global peak in phosphorus production is predicted to occur around 2030. The exact timing of peak phosphorus production might be disputed, however it is widely acknowledged within the fertilizer industry that the quality of remaining phosphate rock is decreasing and production costs are increasing. Yet future access to phosphorus receives little or no international attention. This paper puts forward the case for including long-term phosphorus scarcity on the priority agenda for global food security. Opportunities for recovering phosphorus and reducing demand are also addressed together with institutional challenges. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

This challenge becomes more important in the era of big data and complex statistical modeling.

Although the level of under-five mortality in Cambodia has declined, it remains among the highest in the Asian region. The study analyzes the relationship between under-five mortality and several socio-demographic characteristics of children, mothers, and households, as well as health and health care indicators. The results show a substantial decline in under-five mortality in Cambodia during the ten years from 2000 to 2010. This decline is likely the result of improvements in health status and health care, particularly in maternal and child health services.   The analysis shows that 84 percent of the overall decline in under-five mortality between 2000-2010 can be attributed to multiple births, birth order, birth interval, age of the mother at mother?s use of contraception, antenatal care, tetanus toxoid injection, and geographic region. Between 2005 and 2010 this group of determinants together was responsible for 67 percent of the overall decline in under-five mortality. Overall, the study demonstrates that maternal and child health programs as well as reproductive health and family planning programs have had a positive impact on child survival in Cambodia in the past decade.},

abstract = {Swidden agriculture, or shifting cultivation, is variously viewed as a great environmental threat or a sustainable system of land use. In Laos, swidden has long been considered the primary driver of forest loss nationwide, but the assessment is based exclusively on studies from the north of country, where deforestation is most severe. National policies to control swidden have percolated down to management of one of the largest nature reserves in the region, Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area (NNT NPA) in the Annamite Mountains of central Laos. In NNT NPA, swidden's presumed unsustainability and deleterious impact on forest cover is an untested assumption. We tested it by methods of historical ecology, tracing the patterns of NNT's forest cover and human settlement over the past several decades. Principal sources of data were topographical maps dating to 1943, and Landsat images from 1976, 1989, and 2001. The The analysis shows that, although NNT has been inhabited by swidden cultivators for hundreds of years, it retained more than 95{\%} forest cover until the 1960s–early 1970s. Subsequently, a post-Vietnam War release of human population, possibly coupled with government encouragement of agricultural expansion, precipitated a decline in forest of 0.5{\%}/year until the 1980s. Curiously, this was followed by stability or an increase (ca. 0.3{\%}/year) in forest cover into the current century, even as NNT's human population continued to grow and as forest declined in Laos overall at 1.7{\%}/year, and in two protected areas near NNT at more than 3{\%}/year. A combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors probably account for the stability of NNT's forest cover despite recent population growth. First are cultural propensities for sedentariness and livelihoods with relatively low environmental impact among the ethnic groups inhabiting NNT. Since at least the 1940s, there have been remarkably few changes in the number or location of villages in NNT (and despite upheavals during the Vietnam War). Clearly, “shifting cultivation” is not equivalent to shifting populations. The extent of cleared forest in NNT has remained almost entirely within a swidden–forest mosaic whose boundaries date back at least to the 1960s. Second, the last 20 years have seen an explosion in wildlife trade in the region, particularly of animals valued in traditional medicine. Income earned from wildlife trade may have allowed NNT's residents to purchase rice to feed growing populations, instead of clearing more forest to grow it. The situation presents a dilemma for conservationists—attempts to control local wildlife trade could push NNT's villagers to clear more forest swiddens, and vice versa. Controlling both simultaneously would probably have a negative impact on villagers' standard of living. As wildlife trade is a greater threat to NNT's biodiversity values than local systems of rotational swidden, management should focus first on reducing wildlife trade. In any case, forest conservation (and villagers' welfare) will benefit more from alleviation of of NNT's human population growth than control of its traditional agriculture; it was primarily a shift in demography, not in agricultural practices, that precipitated the post-war period of forest loss. Finally, attempts to reduce local access to swidden land should come only after better understanding of the current swidden systems is achieved, and proven alternatives have been established.},

abstract = {Measurement of child mortality in Zimbabwe has not generated the controversy that has surrounded fertility measurement. It is widely accepted that child mortality has been declining for several decades, and that it has reached levels that are quite low by the standards of sub-Saharan populations. Thus according to a recent UNICEF review (Hill et al., 1997) the under-five mortality rate (U5MR, the probability of dying by age five per 1,000 live births) halved from 1960 to 1990, reaching a level of 80 per thousand in 1990. This rate of decline is similar to the rate of decline in Kenya, through Zimbabwe than in neighboring Botswana, through somewhat faster than in Zambia or Lesotho. Although it is widely accepted that child mortality has declined Zimbabwe, little is known about the precise pattern of the decline, or about differentials between populations subgroups, or about the roles of various development-related changes on the decline. In this paper, data are used from the 1987-88 and 1994 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to explore questions about the timing of change, about differentials, and about the factors associated with change, in particular the relative contributions of improvements in education versus the effects of declining fertility.

abstract = {Large price increases over a short time period can be indicative of a deteriorating food security situation. Food price indices developed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization are often used to monitor food price trends at a global level, but largely reflect supply and demand conditions in export markets. However, reporting by the United States Agency for International Development's Famine Early Warning Systems Network indicates that staple cereal prices in many markets of the developing world, especially in regions that are food insecure areas, are isolated from international export market price trends. Here we present country and regional staple food price indices compiled for improved food security monitoring and assessment, and specifically for monitoring conditions of food access across diverse food insecure regions. We examine the market integration of regional and country level staple food price indices for 35 countries in West, East and Southern Africa and in Central Asia and Central America. We found that cereal price indices constructed using local market prices of within a food insecure region showed significant differences from the international cereals price, and had a variable price dispersion across markets within each marketshed. This work supports the need for improved decision-making about targeted aid and humanitarian relief, by providing earlier warning of food security crises. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was to assess malaria prevalence in relation to rainfall pattern in different localities of Entebbe Municipality, Uganda. A cross sectional study was conducted amongst the local community residing in the area from January 2003 to January 2004 to investigate the incidence and intensity of malaria infection. METHODS: Thick and thin blood smears were made from each patient with fever (body temperature {\textgreater}or= 37.5 degrees C). The slides were examined microscopically for malaria parasites. A total of 616 residents aged 2 to 50 years were registered in the study by name, age, sex and residential location. Spearman correlation coefficient (r) was used to evaluate relationship between parasite density, age and body temperature on one hand and rainfall plus parasite density on the other hand. RESULTS: A direct relationship was observed between malaria transmission and monthly rainfall in Entebbe Municipality. About 69.8{\%} of the patients had fever. Parasite density fluctuated according to monthly rainfall pattern. Two peaks of high parasite density was observed, each peak coinciding with a peak rainfall pattern of the bimodal annual rain seasons. There was a negative but significant correlation (r = -0.09271; p {\textless} 0.0214) between parasite density and age, suggesting that mature individuals clear parasites more effectively than children. Furthermore, we observed a bimodal peak of mean parasite density in children and adults; peak in children is higher than of adults, each peak coinciding with rainfall pattern. There is also a significant positive correlation between parasite density and body temperature (r = 0.1927; p = 0.0001). However, there is no significant variation in mean parasite densities in the different locations of Entebbe Municipality. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms rainfall pattern and age influence parasite density and are important determinants of malaria infection and transmission in Entebbe Municipality. Increased parasite density in children is a useful indicator for monitoring intensity of infection. This information is valuable in policy formulation for control of malaria during periods of intense transmission.},

There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

abstract = {Poor air quality is thought to be an important mortality risk factor globally 1-3, but there is little direct evidence from the developing world on how mortality risk varies with changing exposure to ambient particulate matter. Current global estimates apply exposure-response relationships that have been derived mostly from wealthy, mid-latitude countries to spatial population data 4, and these estimates remain unvalidated across large portions of the globe. Here we combine household survey-based information on the location and timing of nearly 1 million births across sub-Saharan Africa with satellite-based estimates 5 of exposure to ambient respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) to estimate the impact of air quality on mortality rates among infants in Africa. We find that a 10 $\mu$g m-3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with a 9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 4-14{\%}) rise in infant mortality across the dataset. This effect has not declined over the last 15 years and does not diminish with higher levels of household wealth. Our estimates suggest that PM2.5 concentrations above minimum exposure levels were responsible for 22{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 9-35{\%}) of infant deaths in our 30 study countries and led to 449,000 (95{\%} confidence interval, 194,000-709,000) additional deaths of infants in 2015, an estimate that is more than three times higher than existing estimates that attribute death of infants to poor air quality for these countries 2,6 . Upward revision of disease-burden estimates in the studied countries in Africa alone would result in a doubling of current estimates of global deaths of infants that are associated with air pollution, and modest reductions in African PM2.5 exposures are predicted to have health benefits to infants that are larger than most known health interventions.},

abstract = {Abstract The success of agroforestry in semi-arid areas depends on efficient use of available water and effective strategies to limit tree/crop competition and maximise productivity. On hillsides, planting improved tree fallows on the degraded upper section of bench terraces is a recommended practice to improve soil fertility while cropping continues on the lower terrace to maintain food production. This study examined the influence of tree fallows on soil water content ($\theta$w) and evaporation (Es). Alnus acuminata Kunth (alnus), Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner (calliandra), Sesbania sesban L. (sesbania), a mixture of all three species, or sole crops (beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) or maize (Zea mays L.)) were grown on the upper terrace. The same sole crops were grown on the lower terrace. Four management regimes (unpruned, root, shoot and root + shoot pruned) were applied to the tree rows adjacent to the cropping area. Neutron probe and microlysimeter approaches were used to determine $\theta$w and Es when the trees were c. 3.5 years old. Sesbania and alnus increased $\theta$w by 9-18{\%} in the cropping area on the lower terrace but calliandra reduced $\theta$w by 3-15{\%}. After heavy rain, Es comprised 29-38{\%} of precipitation in the tree-based treatments and 53{\%} under sole crops. Absolute values declined as rainfall decreased, but Es as a proportion of rainfall increased to 39-45{\%} in the tree-based treatments and 62{\%} for sole crops. Root + shoot pruning of alnus and the tree mixture increased $\theta$w in the cropping area but had no significant effect in the other tree-based treatments. The results suggest that sesbania and alnus can be planted on smallholdings without compromising water supply to adjacent crops, whereas calliandra decreased water availability despite reducing Es. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of reported effects on crop yield in the same site.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The influence of seasonality on food security and nutritional status is widely accepted. However, research has typically focused on rural households and has not explored the specific mechanisms underlying seasonal effects. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of seasonality in determining the food security and nutritional status of low-income urban households and to isolate specific pathways through which seasonality has its impact. METHODS: Secondary panel data from CARE/IFPRI were utilized. Three rounds of data were collected from approximately 600 households in low-income areas of Dinajpur, Bangladesh, from 2002 through 2003, twice during the monsoon season and once in the dry season. Household-level surveys collected data on income and expenditure, employment, urban agriculture, health, and assets. Height and weight measurements were taken from children between the ages of 6 and 72 months. Paired t-tests and logistic fixed-effects modeling were then used to explore the role of seasonality. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of food insecurity, wasting, and inadequate growth were all significantly higher during the monsoon season as compared with the dry season. Dietary diversity and lost work due to the weather were identified as specific pathways through which season affected household food security. However, mechanisms hypothesized to contribute to seasonal declines in nutritional status, such as child illness, were not found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: Season had a significant effect on both food security and nutritional status in Dinajpur, with households consistently worse off during the monsoon season. Initiatives to promote food market development, support employment during the hunger season, and prevent seasonal declines in nutritional status should be implemented.},

abstract = {Understanding the variability of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle is central to determining the potential for extreme events and susceptibility to future change. In the absence of long-term, large-scale observations of the components of the hydrologic cycle, modeling can provide consistent fields of land surface fluxes and states. This paper describes the creation of a global, 50-yr, 3-hourly, 1.0° dataset of meteorological forcings that can be used to drive models of land surface hydrology. The dataset is constructed by combining a suite of global observation-based datasets with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR) reanalysis. Known biases in the reanalysis precipitation and near-surface meteorology have been shown to exert an erroneous effect on modeled land surface water and energy budgets and are thus corrected using observation-based datasets of precipitation, air temperature, and radiation. Corrections are also made to the rain day statistics of the reanalysis precipitation, which have been found to exhibit a spurious wavelike pattern in high-latitude wintertime. Wind-induced undercatch of solid precipitation is removed using the results from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Solid Precipitation Measurement Intercomparison. Precipitation is disaggregated in space to 1.0° by statistical downscaling using relationships developed with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) daily product. Disaggregation in time from daily to 3 hourly is accomplished similarly, using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3-hourly real-time dataset. Other meteorological variables (downward short- and longwave radiation, specific humidity, surface air pressure, and wind speed) are downscaled in space while accounting for changes in elevation. The dataset is evaluated against the biascorrected forcing dataset of the second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP2). The final product provides a long-term, globally consistent dataset of near-surface meteorological variables that can be used to drive models of the terrestrial hydrologic and ecological processes for the study of seasonal and interannual variability and for the evaluation of coupled models and other land surface prediction schemes.},

This paper sets out a simple non-cooperative model of resource allocation within the household in developing countries that incorporates domestic violence as a vehicle for enhancing bargaining power. We demonstrate that the extent of domestic violence faced by women is not necessarily declining in their reservation utilities, or neces- sarily increasing in their spouses'. Using the National Family Health Survey data of India for 1998-99, we isolate the effect of domestic violence on female autonomy, taking into account the possible endogeneity of domestic violence through the choice of appropriate instruments. We provide some evidence for the evolutionary theory of domestic violence, which argues that such violence stems from the jealousy caused by paternity uncertainty in our evolutionary past. The findings have strong policy implications suggesting that it will take more than an improvement in women's employment options to address the problem of spousal violenc},

The identification strategy exploits exogenous variation in the shocks' geographic extent and the exposure of children's birth cohorts to the shock. We find that in poor and nonpoor households, boys and girls born during the conflict in regions experiencing fighting are negatively affected, with height-for-age z-scores 1.05 standard deviations lower. Conversely, only girls are negatively affected by crop failure, with these girls exhibiting 0.86 standard deviations lower height-for-age z-scores, and the impact is worse for girls in poor households. Results are robust to using alternative shock exposure measures, different geographic boundary definitions for the affected regions, and household-level production and rainfall shocks as alternative measures of crop failure.

abstract = {Environmental conditions in early life are known to have impacts on later health outcomes, but causal mechanisms and potential remedies have been difficult to discern. This paper uses the Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys of 2006 and 2011, combined with earlier NASA satellite observations of variation in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at each child's location and time of birth to identify the trimesters of gestation and periods of infancy when climate variation is linked to attained height later in life. We find significant differences by sex: males are most affected by conditions in their second trimester of gestation, and females in the first three months after birth. Each 100-point difference in NDVI at those times is associated with a difference in height-for-age z-score (HAZ) measured at age 12–59 months of 0.088 for boys and 0.054 for girls, an effect size similar to that of moving within the distribution of household wealth by close to one quintile for boys and one decile for girls. The entire seasonal change in NDVI from peak to trough is approximately 200–300 points during the 2000–2011 study period, implying a seasonal effect on HAZ similar to one to three quintiles of household wealth. This effect is observed only in households without toilets; in households with toilets, there is no seasonal fluctuation, implying protection against climatic conditions that facilitate disease transmission. We also use data from the Nepal Living Standards Surveys on district-level agricultural production and marketing, and find a climate effect on child growth only in districts where households' food consumption derives primarily from their own production. Robustness tests find no evidence of selection effects, and placebo regression results reveal no significant artefactual correlations. The timing and sex-specificity of climatic effects are consistent with previous studies, while the protective effects of household sanitation and food markets are novel indications of mechanisms by which households can gain resilience against adverse climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Coordinating decisions and actions among interacting sectors is a critical component of ecosystem-based management, but uncertainty about coordinated management's effects is compromising its perceived value and use. We constructed an analytical framework for explicitly calculating how coordination affects management decisions, ecosystem state and the provision of ecosystem services in relation to ecosystem dynamics and socio-economic objectives. The central insight is that the appropriate comparison strategy to optimal coordinated management is optimal uncoordinated management, which can be identified at the game theoretic Nash equilibrium. Using this insight we can calculate coordination's effects in relation to uncoordinated management and other reference scenarios. To illustrate how this framework can help identify ecosystem and socio-economic conditions under which coordination is most influential and valuable, we applied it to a heuristic case study and a simulation model for the California Current Marine Ecosystem. Results indicate that coordinated management can more than double an ecosystem's societal value, especially when sectors can effectively manipulate resources that interact strongly. However, societal gains from coordination will need to be reconciled with observations that it also leads to strategic simplification of the ecological food web, and generates both positive and negative impacts on individual sectors and non-target species.},

abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced substantial urbanisation and land degradation processes over the past three decades. Using multi-source satellite imagery combined with geographical and demographic data, this study's aims were to analyse the extent of land cover changes (LCC) and identifying major landscape transformation processes (LTP) and their drivers for four West African cities in Mali, Burkina-Faso, Nigeria and Niger. A common classification scheme was used for a visual interpretation of Corona images from the 1960s and an automated classification of Landsat scenes from 1986, 2000/2001 and 2009. Based on a postclassification comparison LCC were summarized and related to the demographic trends of the past 50 years. Map changes were calculated from 1986 to 2009 to depict LTP (urbanisation, crop expansion, deforestation, and land abandonment) for the cities and their respective hinterlands. To investigate the effect of accessibility and infrastructural factors, LTP were related to the distance to roads, surface water and urban areas. From 1960 to 2009 a large-scale urban agglomeration was detected and the proportion of cultivated land in former natural woody savannas surrounding all four cities increased by 35{\%}. The expansion of cropland during the past 30 years seemed to depend greatly on the availability of irrigation water in the semi-arid Sahelian cities (Kano and Niamey), whilst this was not a major driving factor for the cities of the Sudanian zone (Sikasso and Bobo-Dioulasso). Given the likely increase in water scarcity and land suitable for agriculture, ex ante land use planning and monitoring strategies will become increasingly important. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Drought is a major constraint affecting rice production, especially in rainfed areas of Asia. Despite its importance in rice-growing areas, the magnitude of economic losses arising from drought, its impact on farm households, and farmers' drought coping mechanisms are poorly understood. This article provides insights into these aspects of drought based on a cross-country comparative analysis of rainfed rice-growing areas in southern China, eastern India, and northeast Thailand. The economic cost of drought is found to be substantially higher in eastern India than in the other two countries. Higher probability and greater spatial covariance of drought and less diversified farming systems with rice accounting for a larger share of household income are the main reasons for this higher cost of drought in eastern India. Farmers deploy various coping mechanisms but such mechanisms are largely unable to prevent a reduction in income and consumption, especially in eastern India. As a result, welfare consequences on poor farmers are substantial with a large number of people falling back into poverty during drought years. The overall implications for technology design and for policy improvements for drought mitigation and drought relief are discussed in the light of the empirical findings of the study. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

In many developing countries protein intake falls significantly short of these values. Apart from protein quantity, protein quality including bioavailability and digestibility, from different food sources, are currently on the global agenda. The 1st International Symposium on Dietary Protein for Human Health held in Auckland, in March 2011, and the consecutive Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Expert Consultation on Dietary Protein Quality, both highlighted the importance of assessing the quality of protein from different food sources through determination of amino acid content. Throughout the developed world, animal products and cereals are the two most important sources of protein; in developing countries this order is reversed. In low income countries only 3 {\%} of total dietary energy, as an indicator of diet composition, is derived from meat and offal, 11 {\%} from roots and tubers and 6 {\%} from pulses, nuts and oilseeds. The remainder of the dietary energy is mainly derived from cereal-based staple food. Although the production of livestock has increased in developing countries, the consumption of protein in these countries with people consuming the most limited amounts of protein are continually decreasing. Undernutrition, including insufficient consumption of protein, remains a persistent problem in the developing world, and although many diets within these developing countries are deficient in the quantity of protein compared to recommendations, the quality of the protein also strongly comes into focus.},

abstract = {A consensus has emerged that intimate partner violence contributes to women?s vulnerability to HIV. Most?but not all?cross-sectional studies support this association, while results from longitudinal studies are more mixed. Studies differ in definitions of violence, inclusion of partner data, and extent to which they model potential causal pathways; all of which could account for the variation in their conclusions. The usual interpretation given to an association, if detected, is that violence increases the risk of HIV. Yet, a direct effect is unlikely, since there is no apparent direct pathway leading from most forms of spousal violence to HIV infection, with the exception of sexual violence. This study examines the relationship between spousal violence and women?s HIV status using DHS data from five African countries. It uses couples data and nuanced measures of five forms of violence. We apply a gender-based framework in which the association between spousal violence and a woman?s HIV status are mediated by the couple?s HIV risk factors. A series of models tests the direct effect of spousal violence and role of risk factors as mediators. In multiple countries, a significant association is initially observed between all forms of violence and women?s HIV status, except sexual violence. Associations between spousal violence and risk factors on one hand, and between these factors and women?s HIV status on the other suggest several mediators. When added to the model, spousal violence no longer predicts women?s HIV status, with the exception of physical violence. },

A man married to a woman better employed than himself, for instance, may be irked by her higher achievement and physically abuse her, thus reducing her well‐being achievement (e.g. by undermining her health) and her well‐being freedom (e.g. by reducing her work mobility or social interaction). Empirically the paper focuses especially on a hitherto unexplored factor — a woman's property status — and demonstrates that owning a house or land significantly reduces her risk of marital violence.

abstract = {This study provides estimates of the size and distribution of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in eight sub-Saharan African countries with relatively high HIV prevalence (Cameroon, Cote d?Ivoire, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe), and assesses their situation over several dimensions including schooling and health care. The study finds that substantial proportions of children in these countries are OVC, and that the prevalence of OVC varies widely across countries and across different population sub-groups. Regarding dimensions of OVC?s well-being, the study finds that OVC are disadvantaged in schooling compared to non-OVC. The study also finds that orphans are disadvantaged in the use of mosquito nets and thus are more vulnerable than non-orphans to morbidity and mortality associated with malaria. The study finds that the main vulnerability of orphaned adolescents concerns their schooling: orphaned adolescents are less likely to be in school than non-orphaned adolescents, although they do not seem to be more exploited for their work than non-orphans. Adolescent OVC are also less likely to practice sexual abstinence than non-OVC, but they are not necessarily more prone than non-OVC to other risky sexual behaviors or vulnerable to sexual exploitation. The study finds little evidence that OVC are disadvantaged in health, nutritional status, and health care compared to non-OVC. Nor does the study find a clear disadvantage of OVC in having their basic material needs met. },

abstract = {Summary Background Trend data for causes of child death are crucial to inform priorities for improving child survival by and beyond 2015. We report child mortality by cause estimates in 2000-13, and cause-specific mortality scenarios to 2030 and 2035. Methods We estimated the distributions of causes of child mortality separately for neonates and children aged 1-59 months. To generate cause-specific mortality fractions, we included new vital registration and verbal autopsy data. We used vital registration data in countries with adequate registration systems. We applied vital registration-based multicause models for countries with low under-5 mortality but inadequate vital registration, and updated verbal autopsy-based multicause models for high mortality countries. We used updated numbers of child deaths to derive numbers of deaths by causes. We applied two scenarios to derive cause-specific mortality in 2030 and 2035. Findings Of the 6{\textperiodcentered}3 million children who died before age 5 years in 2013, 51{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (3{\textperiodcentered}257 million) died of infectious causes and 44{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}761 million) died in the neonatal period. The three leading causes are preterm birth complications (0{\textperiodcentered}965 million [15{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}, uncertainty range (UR) 9{\textperiodcentered}8-24{\textperiodcentered}5]; UR 0{\textperiodcentered}615-1{\textperiodcentered}537 million), pneumonia (0{\textperiodcentered}935 million [14{\textperiodcentered}9{\%}, 13{\textperiodcentered}0-16{\textperiodcentered}8]; 0{\textperiodcentered}817-1{\textperiodcentered}057 million), and intrapartum-related complications (0{\textperiodcentered}662 million [10{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}, 6{\textperiodcentered}7-16{\textperiodcentered}8]; 0{\textperiodcentered}421-1{\textperiodcentered}054 million). Reductions in pneumonia, diarrhoea, and measles collectively were responsible for half of the 3{\textperiodcentered}6 million fewer deaths recorded in 2013 versus 2000. Causes with the slowest progress were congenital, preterm, neonatal sepsis, injury, and other causes. If present trends continue, 4{\textperiodcentered}4 million children younger than 5 years will still die in 2030. Furthermore, sub-Saharan Africa will have 33{\%} of the births and 60{\%} of the deaths in 2030, compared with 25{\%} and 50{\%} in 2013, respectively. Interpretation Our projection results provide concrete examples of how the distribution of child causes of deaths could look in 15-20 years to inform priority setting in the post-2015 era. More evidence is needed about shifts in timing, causes, and places of under-5 deaths to inform child survival agendas by and beyond 2015, to end preventable child deaths in a generation, and to count and account for every newborn and every child.

At the height of the monsoon season, 71{\%} of children were moderately stunted, but none was wasted (mean -2.61 SD height-for-age and -0.91 SD weight-for-height by reference to NCHS z-score values). Measures of stunting deteriorated from moderate to severe after 1 year of age. No differences by sex or ethnicity were detected. Environmental changes from the winter to the monsoon seasons were reflected in significant losses of weight and lower weight-for-height z-scores, especially for 0-35 month-olds, although height for 12-35-month-olds continued to be gained over this period. Growth velocity was significantly related to previous growth status (thinner and shorter children did not show catch-up in height or weight) and to morbidity reported over the period of observation. The prevalence of illnesses rose six-fold from the winter to the monsoon, and children with a high frequency of illnesses experienced a significant shortfall in weight and height increments. A poor diet and recurrent illnesses explain the slow and uneven growth of these children. Despite an increase in women's agricultural workloads in the monsoon season, childcare patterns per se do not seem to adversely affect small children. Small stature through later childhood and in adults is one consequence of the growth pattern seen at these young ages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe monthly variation in growth pattern was examined for 71 boys and girls aged 0-49 months of age in rural Nepal.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ethnobotanical studies in Mexico have documented that Mesoamerican peoples practise systems of in situ management of wild and weedy vegetation directed to control availability of useful plants. In situ management includes let standing, encouraging growing and protection of individual plants of useful species during clearance of vegetation, which in some cases may involve artificial selection. The aim of this study was to review, complement and re-analyse information from three case studies which examined patterns of morphological, physiological and genetic effects of artificial selection in plant populations under in situ management in the region.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Information on wild and in situ managed populations of the herbaceous weedy plants Anoda cristata and Crotalaria pumila, the tree Leucaena esculenta subsp. esculenta and the columnar cacti Escontria chiotilla, Polaskia chichipe and Stenocereus stellatus from Central Mexico was re-analysed. Analyses compared morphology and frequency of morphological variants, germination patterns, and population genetics parameters between wild and managed in situ populations of the species studied. Species of columnar cacti are under different management intensities and their populations, including cultivated stands of P. chichipe and S. stellatus, were also compared between species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Significant differences in morphology, germination patterns and genetic variation documented between wild, in situ managed and cultivated populations of the species studied are associated with higher frequencies of phenotypes favoured by humans in managed populations. Genetic diversity in managed populations of E. chiotilla and P. chichipe is slightly lower than in wild populations but in managed populations of S. stellatus variation was higher than in the wild. However, genetic distance between populations was generally small and influenced more by geographic distance than by management.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Artificial selection operating on in situ managed populations of the species analysed is causing incipient domestication. This process could be acting on any of the 600-700 plant species documented to be under in situ management in Mesoamerica. In situ domestication of plants could be relevant to understand early processes of domestication and current conditions of in situ conservation of plant genetic resources.},

abstract = {Since the year 2000, a concerted campaign against malaria has led to unprecedented levels of intervention coverage across sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the effect of this control effort is vital to inform future control planning. However, the effect of malaria interventions across the varied epidemiological settings of Africa remains poorly understood owing to the absence of reliable surveillance data and the simplistic approaches underlying current disease estimates. Here we link a large database of malaria field surveys with detailed reconstructions of changing intervention coverage to directly evaluate trends from 2000 to 2015, and quantify the attributable effect of malaria disease control efforts. We found that Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in endemic Africa halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40{\%} between 2000 and 2015. We estimate that interventions have averted 663 (542-753 credible interval) million clinical cases since 2000. Insecticide-treated nets, the most widespread intervention, were by far the largest contributor (68{\%} of cases averted). Although still below target levels, current malaria interventions have substantially reduced malaria disease incidence across the continent. Increasing access to these interventions, and maintaining their effectiveness in the face of insecticide and drug resistance, should form a cornerstone of post-2015 control strategies.},

USAID and Title II implementing partners face challenges in measuring the success of Title II programs in reducing household food insecurity because of the technical difficulty and cost of collecting and analyzing data on traditional food security indicators, such as per capita income and caloric adequacy. The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) holds promise as an easier and more user-friendly approach for measuring the access component of household food security. To support the consistent and comparable collection of the HFIAS, efforts are under way to develop a guide with a standardized questionnaire and data collection and analysis instructions. A set of domains have been identified that is deemed to capture the universal experience of the access component of household food insecurity across countries and cultures. Based on these domains, a set of questions has been developed with wording that is deemed to be universally appropriate, with minor adaptation to local contexts. These underlying suppositions, based on research in multiple countries, are being verified by potential users of the guide. The key remaining issue relates to the process for creating a categorical indicator of food insecurity status from the HFIAS.},

abstract = {Globally, the impressive gains in under-five mortality between 2000 and 2010 have been accompanied by more modest reductions in neonatal mortality. Of the 18 USAID priority countries for maternal and child health with two DHS surveys available around the years 2000 and 2010, only nine have shown statistically significant reductions in neonatal mortality. In six of the nine countries, these reductions remain significant after restricting the study population to most recent children born in the five years preceding the survey. The study investigates the extent to which scale-up of maternal and delivery care is associated with reductions in neonatal mortality among most recent children born in the six countries. We find surprisingly little evidence that changes in coverage of measurable indicators of maternal and delivery care contributed to the improvements in neonatal survival. In the three malarious countries with complete mosquito bednet data for both surveys, household ownership of a mosquito bednet stands out as a driver of the observed reductions. This finding highlights the importance of malaria control in the arsenal of maternal and child health interventions. Overall, weak associations between other indicators of maternal and delivery care and neonatal survival were observed. This may be the result of limitations of population-based surveys to measure accurately the protective aspects of the interventions. The weak findings may also point to an issue of quality of care, highlighting the need to ensure that there is an emphasis on strengthening health systems and improving the quality of care alongside efforts to increase use of delivery health services. },

Results indicate the successful discrimination of irrigated land from other land use classes, but also the problem of separating natural vegetation from quasi-natural rainfed agriculture. This problem is attributed to the scale on which agriculture is practiced (small scale) and the inadequate spatial and temporal resolution of the Landsat instrument to capture the agricultural fields and cropping systems.

First, it presents a profile of households that are poor, “food poor,” or have malnourished children. Second, it explores the impact of recent weather and price shocks on household welfare and identifies those affected most by the shocks. Finally, it estimates vulnerability to poverty by modeling both households' expected consumption and their consumption volatility, and by distinguishing between idiosyncratic and covariate risks. The basic results of the analysis match conventional knowledge about poverty, food poverty, and malnutrition. The prevalence of chronic malnutrition is high in Mali, with 44 percent of Malian households and 66 percent of food poor Malian households having at least one stunted child. A 25 percent increase in cereal prices and a 25 percent decrease in cereal production are estimated to increase the number of food poor by 610,000 people. An estimated US{\$} 5.4 million of extra aid per year will be needed to lift the newly food poor above the food poverty line. About US{\$} 182 million is needed to do this for all existing and new food poor. Vulnerability incidence is in general two to three times higher among the poor than the non-poor, except in urban areas and in the region of Sikasso where the vulnerability incidence is five to six times higher among the poor. Overall, vulnerability is mostly driven by poverty induced vulnerability, except in the capital, Bamako, where vulnerability is more driven by risk induced vulnerability},

abstract = {Micronutrient deficiency affects about a third of the world's population. Children in developing countries are particularly vulnerable. Consequences include impaired cognitive and physical development and increased childhood morbidity and mortality. Recent studies suggest that forests help alleviate micronutrient deficiency by increasing dietary diversity. However, evidence is mostly based on weakly designed local case studies of limited relevance to global policies. Furthermore, impacts of forests on diet vary among communities, and understanding this variation can help target actions to enhance impact. We compile data on children's diets in over 43,000 households across 27 developing countries to examine the impacts of forests on dietary diversity. We use empirical designs that are attentive to assumptions necessary for causal interpretations and that adequately account for confounding factors that could mask or mimic the impact. We find that high exposure to forests causes children to have at least 25{\%} greater dietary diversity compared to lack of exposure, a result comparable to the impacts of some nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs. A closer look at a subset of African countries indicates that impacts are generally higher for less developed communities, but highest with certain access to markets, roads, and education. Our results also indicate that forests could help reduce vitamin A and iron deficiencies. Our study establishes the causal relationship between forests and diet and thus strengthens the evidence for integrating forest conservation and management into nutrition interventions. Our results also suggest that providing households some access to capital can increase the impact of forest-related interventions on nutrition.},

abstract = {Between 2000 and 2010 a dramatic decline in under-five mortality in Rwanda was accompanied by a more modest reduction in the neonatal mortality rate (NMR). The improvement in the NMR was largely concentrated in rural areas, where coverage of maternal and delivery care services has increased most, with little improvement in urban areas, where coverage was already more widespread. This suggests that the improvement in NMR was driven by an increase in coverage of maternal and delivery care services, rather than an improvement in quality of care for those receiving services. This finding highlights the need to build on the success in expanding coverage by paying increased attention to the quality of services, to ensure that their full benefits are realized.  The study identified several key indicators of maternal care and other interventions with improved coverage between the 2000 and 2010 DHS surveys, including delivery by a health professional, delivery in a facility, use of antenatal care (ANC) services, early initiation of breastfeeding, and mosquito net ownership. Three of these indicators?use of ANC services, early initiation of breastfeeding, and mosquito net ownership?were found to be associated with lower probabilities of neonatal death, after adjusting for socio-demographic factors. Even after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and the mother?s use of maternal care services, mosquito net ownership remained independently associated with the reduction in neonatal mortality. This finding reinforces the importance of consistent and universal mosquito net use in areas with high prevalence of malaria.},

abstract = {Although the 2006 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) did collect data on the caste/ethnic identity of its respondents, the initial analysis of the DHS did not examine those dimensions. Analysis by caste or ethnic identity is generally avoided in the analysis of the main findings of the DHS primarily to avoid potentially controversial social categories ? which in some countries might reduce government buy-in to critical findings on population and health.  However in Nepal, there is wide recognition that an understanding of these dimensions is essential to the development of inclusive policies and programs that respond more effectively to the legitimate needs and demands of Nepal?s diverse population. The approach paper to the National Planning Commission?s Three Year Interim Plan and the Plan itself are very open about the barriers certain groups have faced in accessing public services and resources in the past and the disparities in outcomes that this has caused. Both documents call for better data and analysis of these disparities as the foundation for more equitable resource allocation and delivery of public services. This paper hopes to make a modest contribution to the ongoing process of understanding and responding to Nepal?s diversity by carrying out an initial examination of the 2006 DHS through the lens of caste, ethnic and regional identity. This paper will also keep the gender dimension central since women?s membership in different social groups is a major factor in their health and development outcomes.},

abstract = {Recognizing the demographic significance of the woman's age at first marriage or union and age at birth of the first child in the establishment of fertility levels, the information derived from the Encuesta Nacional de Salud Materno-Infantil 1987 was utilized to analyze both variables. Median age was analyzed by ethnic group, residence, education, marital status, and characteristics related to the work force. In all of these aspects, consistent differences were found. In additional, life tables were calculated for both events, applying the Coale model and utilizing the program NUPITAL. This model was very appropriate, given the goodness of fit, which was met for both legally married and consensually mated women. The model adequately describes the behavior of the Ladino and Indian populations separately, thus indicating the generalizeability of the model. Finally, demographic impact on the level of fertility of both age groups was determined and calculations made of the interbirth interval. },

abstract = {Decades ago, discussion of an impending global pandemic of obesity was thought of as heresy. But in the 1970s, diets began to shift towards increased reliance upon processed foods, increased away-from-home food intake, and increased use of edible oils and sugar-sweetened beverages. Reductions in physical activity and increases in sedentary behavior began to be seen as well. The negative effects of these changes began to be recognized in the early 1990s, primarily in low- and middle-income populations, but they did not become clearly acknowledged until diabetes, hypertension, and obesity began to dominate the globe. Now, rapid increases in the rates of obesity and overweight are widely documented, from urban and rural areas in the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to populations in countries with higher income levels. Concurrent rapid shifts in diet and activity are well documented as well. An array of large-scale programmatic and policy measures are being explored in a few countries; however, few countries are engaged in serious efforts to prevent the serious dietary challenges being faced.},

We discuss what is known about the human health implications of changes in the structure and function of natural systems and propose that these changes are affecting human health in a variety of important ways. We identify several gaps and limitations in the research that has been done to date and propose a more systematic and comprehensive approach to applied research in this field. Such efforts could lead to a more robust understanding of the human health impacts of accelerating environmental change and inform decision making in the land-use planning, environmental conservation, and public health policy realms.},

Methods: Convenience sample of 212 food pantry clients in Hartford, CT from June, 2010 to May, 2011. Main outcomes included food security (United States Department of Agriculture module), fruit and vegetable consumption (Block Screener), and BMI (stadiometer and digital medical scale). Chi-square tests, Spearman correlations, and logistic regression models were analyzed. Results: Over half of the sample (50.5{\%}) had very low food security. Mean BMI was 29.5 kg/m2. Age was positively associated with food security (P {\textless} .01). Food-secure participants were twice as likely to eat fruit, vegetables, and fiber as food-insecure participants (P = .04).

abstract = {The term "stunting" has become pervasive in international nutrition and child health research, program, and policy circles. Although originally intended as a population-level statistical indicator of children's social and economic deprivation, the conventional anthropometric definition of stunting (height-for-age z scores {\textless}-2 SD) is now widely used to define chronic malnutrition. Epidemiologists often portray it as a disease, making inferences about the causes of growth faltering based on comparisons between stunted (i.e., undernourished) and nonstunted children. Stunting is commonly used to monitor public health and nutrition program effectiveness alongside calls for the "elimination of stunting." However, there is no biological basis for the -2 SD cutoff to define stunting, making it a poor individual-level classifier of malnutrition or disease. In fact, in many low- and middle-income countries, children above and below the threshold are similarly affected by growth-limiting exposures. We argue that the common use of stunting as an indicator of child linear growth has contributed to unsubstantiated assumptions about the biological mechanisms underlying linear growth impairment in low- and middle-income countries and has led to a systematic underestimation of the burden of linear growth deficits among children in low-resource settings. Moreover, because nutrition-specific short-term public health interventions may result in relatively minor changes in child height, the use of stunting prevalence to monitor health or nutrition program effectiveness may be inappropriate. A more nuanced approach to the application and interpretation of stunting as an indicator in child growth research and public health programming is warranted.},

This volume, which includes eight studies reporting on the results of the 1992 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey, provides further valuable perspectives on the fertility and family planning situation in Egypt. A basic theme in the papers included in this volume is the magnitude of the change that has occurred in fertility and family planning behavior in Egypt since 1980.The obvious challenge is how to sustain this progress. In addressing that challenge, the family program must address the diversity of fertility attitudes and needs in Egypt. },

abstract = {Background: Up-to-date information on the causes of child deaths is crucial to guide global efforts to improve child survival. We report new estimates for 2008 of the major causes of death in children younger than 5 years. Methods: We used multicause proportionate mortality models to estimate deaths in neonates aged 0-27 days and children aged 1-59 months, and selected single-cause disease models and analysis of vital registration data when available to estimate causes of child deaths. New data from China and India permitted national data to be used for these countries instead of predictions based on global statistical models, as was done previously. We estimated proportional causes of death for 193 countries, and by application of these proportions to the country-specific mortality rates in children younger than 5 years and birth rates, the numbers of deaths by cause were calculated for countries, regions, and the world. Findings: Of the estimated 8{\textperiodcentered}795 million deaths in children younger than 5 years worldwide in 2008, infectious diseases caused 68{\%} (5{\textperiodcentered}970 million), with the largest percentages due to pneumonia (18{\%}, 1{\textperiodcentered}575 million, uncertainty range [UR] 1{\textperiodcentered}046 million-1{\textperiodcentered}874 million), diarrhoea (15{\%}, 1{\textperiodcentered}336 million, 0{\textperiodcentered}822 million-2{\textperiodcentered}004 million), and malaria (8{\%}, 0{\textperiodcentered}732 million, 0{\textperiodcentered}601 million-0{\textperiodcentered}851 million). 41{\%} (3{\textperiodcentered}575 million) of deaths occurred in neonates, and the most important single causes were preterm birth complications (12{\%}, 1{\textperiodcentered}033 million, UR 0{\textperiodcentered}717 million-1{\textperiodcentered}216 million), birth asphyxia (9{\%}, 0{\textperiodcentered}814 million, 0{\textperiodcentered}563 million-0{\textperiodcentered}997 million), sepsis (6{\%}, 0{\textperiodcentered}521 million, 0{\textperiodcentered}356 million-0{\textperiodcentered}735 million), and pneumonia (4{\%}, 0{\textperiodcentered}386 million, 0{\textperiodcentered}264 million-0{\textperiodcentered}545 million). 49{\%} (4{\textperiodcentered}294 million) of child deaths occurred in five countries: India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, and China. Interpretation: These country-specific estimates of the major causes of child deaths should help to focus national programmes and donor assistance. Achievement of Millennium Development Goal 4, to reduce child mortality by two-thirds, is only possible if the high numbers of deaths are addressed by maternal, newborn, and child health interventions.

abstract = {Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health concern in Tanzania because of its prevalence and documented negative effect on pregnancy outcomes. There has been limited information available in Tanzania on the relationship between IPV and women?s use of reproductive and maternal health services. This study uses data from the most recent DHS survey  in Tanzania to examine the associations between IPV, women?s empowerment, and use of reproductive and maternal health services, taking into account the effects of key socio-demographic variables.  The study analyzed the data on 4,471 currently married or cohabiting women age 15?49 interviewed with the domestic violence module in the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS). Thirty-nine percent of the women reported physical or sexual violence by their current partner at least once. Thirty percent of the women were defined as ?empowered? according to participation in household decision-making.  After controlling for other factors, women?s empowerment was found to be associated with 1) use of modern contraceptive methods, 2) having four or more antenatal care visits, and 3) use of a skilled birth attendant during delivery. No significant associations were found between IPV and the use of any of these three reproductive and maternal health services.  The findings suggest that in Tanzania women?s empowerment has a strong influence on their use of reproductive and maternal health services. To improve women?s health and that of their children there is a need for multi-sector collaboration in developing programs and interventions to improve women?s empowerment, increase educational attainment, and reduce gender-based violence.},

Findings indicate a number of demographic shifts which may affect adolescent lives. The proportion of adolescents? age 15-19 living in rural areas has declined in more than half of the countries surveyed. The proportion of women with no education continues to be greater than that of men, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South/Southeast Asia. The percentage of women currently working is decreasing in the majority of countries while the percentage of men currently working is increasing. Less than one-third of adolescent women and less than 3 percent of adolescent men are married by age 15 in most countries. The proportion of adolescent women who report having sexual intercourse in the past 12 months has increased in more than half of the countries surveyed. Sex with multiple partners and/or nonmarital or noncohabiting partners is greater in nearly every instance for men than for women. Condom use and other contraceptive use has not changed substantially over time. In the majority of countries, there is a slight decline in the proportion of adolescent women who have ever been pregnant. More young women have received antenatal care and assistance from a skilled provider at delivery.  The results of the report illustrate the need for targeted efforts to improve adolescents? sexual and reproductive health and contributing factors. },

abstract = {Conservation science needs to engage the general public to ensure successful conservation interventions. Although online technologies such as Twitter and Facebook offer new opportunities to accelerate communication between conservation scientists and the online public, factors influencing the spread of conservation news in online media are not well understood. We explored transmission of conservation research through online news articles with generalized linear mixed-effects models and an information theoretic approach. In particular, we assessed differences in the frequency conservation research is featured on online news sites and the impact of online conservation news content and delivery on Facebook likes and shares and Twitter tweets. Five percent of articles in conservation journals are reported in online news, and the probability of reporting depended on the journal. There was weak evidence that articles on climate change and mammals were more likely to be featured. Online news articles about charismatic mammals with illustrations were more likely to be shared or liked on Facebook and Twitter, but the effect of news sites was much larger. These results suggest journals have the greatest impact on which conservation research is featured and that news site has the greatest impact on how popular an online article will be on Facebook and Twitter.

Aunque tecnologias en linea como Twitter y Facebook ofrecen nuevas oportunidades para acelerar la comunicacion entre los cientificos de la conservacion y el publico en linea, los factores que influyen sobre el esparcimiento de las noticias de conservacion en los medios en linea no estan bien entendidos. Exploramos la transmision de la investigacion de la conservacion a traves de articulos en linea con modelos lineales generalizados de efectos mixtos y un enfoque teorico de informacion. En particular, evaluamos las diferencias en la frecuencia con la que la investigacion de la conservacion es incluida en sitios en linea de noticias y el impacto del contenido y la forma de comunicarse de las noticias de conservacion sobre los likes y numero de veces que se comparte en Facebook y sobre los tuits en Twitter. El 5{\%} de los articulos de las revistas de conservacion se reportan en noticias en linea y la probabilidad de reportar dependio de la revista. Hubo evidencias debiles de que los articulos sobre el cambio climatico y los mamiferos tuvieran mayor probabilidad de ser incluidos. Las noticias en linea sobre mamiferos carismaticos con ilustraciones fueron mas probables de ser compartidas o que obtuvieran likes en Facebook y Twitter, pero el efecto de los sitios de noticias fue mucho mayor. Estos resultados sugieren que las revistas tienen el mayor impacto sobre cual investigacion se incluye y que los sitios de noticias tienen el mayor impacto sobre cuan popular sera un articulo en Facebook o Twitter.},

abstract = {Web-crawling approaches, that is, automated programs data mining the internet to obtain information about a particular process, have recently been proposed for monitoring early signs of ecosystem degradation or for establishing crop calendars. However, lack of a clear conceptual and methodological framework has prevented the development of such approaches within the field of conservation biology. Our objective was to illustrate how Google Trends, a freely accessible web-crawling engine, can be used to track changes in timing of biological processes, spatial distribution of invasive species, and level of public awareness about key conservation issues. Google Trends returns the number of internet searches that were made for a keyword in a given region of the world over a defined period. Using data retrieved online for 13 countries, we exemplify how Google Trends can be used to study the timing of biological processes, such as the seasonal recurrence of pollen release or mosquito outbreaks across a latitudinal gradient. We mapped the spatial extent of results from Google Trends for 5 invasive species in the United States and found geographic patterns in invasions that are consistent with their coarse-grained distribution at state levels. From 2004 through 2012, Google Trends showed that the level of public interest and awareness about conservation issues related to ecosystem services, biodiversity, and climate change increased, decreased, and followed both trends, respectively. Finally, to further the development of research approaches at the interface of conservation biology, collective knowledge, and environmental management, we developed an algorithm that allows the rapid retrieval of Google Trends data.

abstract = {Patterns of forest cover and forest degradation determine the size and types of ecosystem services forests provide. Particularly in low-income countries, nontimber forest product (NTFP) extraction by rural people, which provides important resources and income to the rural poor, contributes to the level and pattern of forest degradation. Although recent policy, particularly in Africa, emphasizes forest degradation, relatively little research describes the spatial aspects of NTFP collection that lead to spatial degradation patterns. This paper reviews both the spatial empirical work on NTFP extraction and related forest degradation patterns, and spatial models of behavior of rural people who extract NTFPs from forest. Despite the impact of rural people's behavior on resulting quantities and patterns of forest resources, spatial-temporal models/patterns rarely inform park siting and sizing decisions, econometric assessments of park effectiveness, development projects to support conservation, or REDD protocols. Using the literature review as a lens, we discuss the models' implications for these policies with particular emphasis on effective conservation spending and leakage. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

Beyond the assumption of unconfoundedness, however, these methods also require the model for the propensity score to be correctly specified.

In this paper, we extend the CBPS to a continuous treatment. We propose the covariate balancing generalized propensity score ( CBGPS ) methodology, which minimizes the association between covariates and the treatment. We develop both parametric and nonparametric approaches and show their superior performance over the standard maximum likelihood estimation in a simulation study. The CBGPS methodology is applied to an observational study, whose goal is to estimate the causal effects of political advertisements on campaign contributions.

The main objective of the study was to determine whether the pattern of higher Muslim fertility remains when important social and economic covariates are taken into account. These factors include education, wealth, rural-urban residence, exposure to mass media, child mortality, and measures of gender equality. The multivariate analyses reported here do not support the expectation that these socioeconomic covariates are responsible for the fertility-related differences between Muslim and non-Muslim women, although in some instances they reduce the magnitude of existing differences between groups.  },

In a recent publication (Hein {\&} de Ridder, 2006) it was proposed that an incorrect understanding of the relationship between RUE and rainfall has led to a misinterpretation of the satellite record of desertification in the African Sahel. Here, we examine this suggestion and show that, contrary to Hein and de Ridder's statement, satellite studies of Sahelian RUE have reported increases, decreases, and constant values since 1981. Furthermore, we find that data do not support their proposal that RUE increases with rainfall, even in nondegraded areas. Hence we reject their corollary, that constant RUE is prima facie evidence of desertification. The fundamental difficulty with the use of RUE for detection of desertification remains, that is the difficulty of estimation of the RUE for nondegraded land at a regional scale.},

abstract = {A quarter of the 169 million hectares of Congo Basin lowland dense forest have been allocated to logging concessions. Over 80 tree species are commercially felled for timber in Cameroon, and 1.2 m cubic meters of timber are consumed annually on informal domestic markets in Central African cities. However, 61 {\%} of timber species in the Congo Basin also bear locally used non-timber forest products (NTFP). Amongst these are the fruits of Baillonella toxisperma and edible caterpillars hosted by Entandrophragma cylindricum and Erythrophleum suaveolens. A participatory inventory of these species was conducted around two villages adjacent to each of two logging concessions in Cameroon to map trees of these species from which local men and women gather food resources on one-day collection trips. The distance from villages to trees was measured to determine the spatial overlap between NTFP collection and logging concessions. The distance between the villages and the trees varies by village, gender of the collector and the tree species, ranging 390 m-6.2 km, with 95 {\%} of the trees located within a range of 5 km. Only 10 {\%} of these trees fall within concession boundaries, but multi-day trips take place to collect these resources further within logging concessions, and the overlap of concession boundaries with a 5 km 'resource shed' ranges from 22 ha to 3777 ha, and could have an impact on the one-day collection distance. Although collection of these resources was generally not found to be a gender-specific activity, 10 {\%} of the trees were collected from by men at 4.1–6.2 km and by women at a distance of under 3km as a result of the spatial spread of other gendered activities. Using a 2.8 km (average) collection radius from the village to represent a resource shed for 4111 mapped villages in the forests of Cameroon, an area of over 10 m ha of forest is required to safeguard forest-dependent livelihoods, and 495000 ha of this will overlap with logging concession boundaries. Currently under 2 m ha have been designated as community or communal forests, and this gap should be addressed using participatory mapping in order to improve forest resource access and tenure through stakeholder dialogue and local geospatial knowledge.},

We constructed a use value (UV) index combining the use frequency (U) and the quality perception (Q) of useful plant species by local people. We identified all plant species used by the Raramuri and classified them into 14 general use categories. We interviewed 34 households in the village to compare men and women's knowledge on the five main general use categories, and on their respective sub-categories and specific uses, to document how they practice gathering activities and to calculate scores of plants UV. A total of 226 useful plant species were identified, but only 12{\%} of them had high UV scores for the specific uses defined. When the overall knowledge of plants was examined, no significant differences were detected between men and women, but significant differences were identified in general use categories such as medicinal plants, plants for construction and domestic goods, but not in plants used as food and firewood. We identified a labor division in gathering activities associated to gender, women mainly gathering medicinal and edible plants and being involved in preparing medicines and food, whereas men mainly gathering and using plants for manufacturing domestic goods, firewood and building plants. Plant species UV associated to gender were significantly different between men and women at the level of specific uses in the general category of domestic goods and building.

abstract = {Illegal trade in wildlife is booming on e-commerce platforms1 , the ‘dark web'2 and social media1,3 . The ease of access and high number of users of social media make it a particularly concerning venue1,3,4 . Wildlife dealers use social media to release photos and information about products to attract customers and to market their products to networks of contacts. We currently lack the tools for automated monitoring of high-volume data that are needed to investigate and prevent this illegal trade, but machine-learning algorithms offer a way forward. Operating within the broader field of artificial intelligence, the concept of machine learning refers to algorithms that learn from data without human guidance. Deep-learning algorithms5 are a family of these algorithms that are highly successful in classifying image contents and locating individual objects within them, and in processing natural language. Applying these techniques to social media data allows human behaviour to be investigated on an unprecedented scale. Yet these techniques and data sources are still rarely used to address drivers of the biodiversity crisis6 . Many social media platforms provide an application programming interface that allows access to user-generated text, images and videos, as well as to accompanying metadata, such as where and when the content was uploaded, and connections between users. Processing such data manually is inefficient and time consuming, but machine-learning algorithms can be trained to filter this content to identify relevant information (see Fig. 1 for an example). These algorithms can be trained to detect which species or wildlife products, such as horns or scales, appear in an image or video, while also classifying their setting, such as a natural habitat or a marketplace. When processing video, algorithms can use audio clues, such as identifying bird species by their songs and calls, as well as interrogating the image stream. Natural language processing can be used to infer the meaning of a verbal description, for example, whether an animal or plant is for sale or observed in nature, and to classify the sentiment and preferences of social media users. To unlock this potential, social media platforms must be engaged to share their data and actively collaborate in the development of real-time monitoring tools that can be used to automatically identify content pertaining to the illegal wildlife trade, and to report this content to enforcers. Furthermore, machine-learning algorithms need human- verified training data. Such training datasets may be generated through crowd-sourcing initiatives, and collaborations between scientists and enforcers may further improve the algorithms' performance.

abstract = {The founding argument of this paper is that the commons have been dangerously neglected in agrarian reform and with greatest ill-effect upon the poor. Neglect stems from analytical failures as to the ownership of commons, exacerbated by the dominance of collateralization as the rationale for rights registration and built around individually owned properties. Agrarian reform in the 21st century needs to change focus, making security of the commons a primary objective. For it is these properties-not farms and houses-which are most vulnerable to wrongful appropriation and other involuntary losses. New strategy needs to be founded upon legal acknowledgement for commons as the private and registrable group-owned property of communities and integral support for the community-based customary regimes which deliver and sustain those interests. Side benefits include practical opportunity for overcoming perceived and real conflict between statutory and customary law and provision of a viable route to realising democratic devolution of majority rural land administration. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Animal source foods (ASF) provide critical micronutrients in highly bioavailable forms, with the potential to efficiently address undernutrition among young children living in developing countries. There is limited evidence for how livestock ownership might increase ASF intake in poor households either through own-consumption or income generation. Along with lack of nutrition knowledge, gender dimensions may affect the pathways leading from livestock ownership to child ASF intake and ultimately to young child growth. Using data from a large-scale impact evaluation conducted in Kenya, this study tested the hypothesis that co-owned/female-owned livestock would be associated with improved child growth, mediated by increases in ASF consumption. Data were collected from September 2010 to January 2011 from households in six provinces in Kenya on a broad range of agricultural, economic, social, health and nutrition factors. Children ages 6–60 months were included in this analysis (n = 183). In this sample, co-owned/female-owned livestock was valued at 18,861 Kenyan shillings in contrast with male-owned livestock valued at 66,343 Kenyan shillings. Multivariate linear regression models showed a positive association between co-owned/female-owned livestock with child weight-for-age z score (WAZ) after adjusting for caregiver education level, income, child age, and child sex. A mediating effect by child ASF intake was evident, explaining 25{\%} of the relationship of livestock ownership with child WAZ, by Sobel–Goodman test (p {\textless} .05). A trend towards significance was demonstrated for co-owned/female-owned livestock and height-for-age z score (HAZ), and no effect was apparent for weight-for-height z score (WHZ). The partial mediating effect may be indicative of other factors inherent in co-owned/female-owned livestock such as higher status of females in these households with greater influence over other child care practices promoting growth. Nonetheless, our study suggests targeting females in livestock production programming may better ensure improvements in child nutrition.},

abstract = {Food composition provides an important link for biodiversity and nutrition. Biodiversity at three levels-ecosystems, the species they contain and the genetic diversity within species-can contribute to food security and improved nutrition. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) are leading a new international initiative on biodiversity for food and nutrition under the umbrella of the Convention of Biological Diversity. The overall aim is to promote the sustainable use of biodiversity in programmes contributing to food security and human nutrition, and to thereby raise awareness of the importance of this link for sustainable development. Further research is needed to increase the evidence base by filling our knowledge gaps with better inventories and more data on composition and consumption. If nutrient analysis and data dissemination of the various food species and intra-species diversity are systematically undertaken, national information systems for food and agriculture will be strengthened and can be used to form the basis for priority setting and national policy making. For nutrition, this will mean introducing more compositional data on biodiversity in national food composition databases and tables; developing and using dietary assessment instruments that capture food intake at the species and variety/breed level; and allowing food labelling that encourages awareness of food plant varieties and food animal subspecies. Nutrition and biodiversity feature directly the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): halve the proportion of people who suffer from hunger; and ensure environmental sustainability. In combination, a nutrition and biodiversity initiative provides the very foundation for achieving these MDGs. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

Overview

WHO releases a quantitative assessment of the health impacts of climate change. This constitutes an update and a further development of the assessment that was first published by WHO for the year 2000, now with a wider range of health impacts, and projections for future years.

The assessment takes into account a subset of the possible health impacts, and assumes continued economic growth and health progress. Even under these conditions, it concludes that climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050; 38 000 due to heat exposure in elderly people, 48 000 due to diarrhoea, 60 000 due to malaria, and 95 000 due to childhood undernutrition. Results indicate that the burden of disease from climate change in the future will continue to fall mainly on children in developing countries, but that other population groups will be increasingly affected.},

abstract = {In Zimbabwe, levels of spousal Gender-Based Violence (GBV) remain a health, human rights and development concern. The main objective of this study was to investigate the association between spousal GBV and women?s empowerment among women aged 15-49 who were currently in union or living with a man. The analysis utilised the 2010-11 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) data. Spousal violence was measured by different forms of GBV i.e. physical, emotional, sexual violence and overall GBV. Overall, 48{\%} of women of reproductive age who are in a union experience some type of GBV. More specifically, 27{\%} report physical violence, 26{\%} sexual violence and 25{\%} emotional violence. The analysis showed that women who did not participate in decision-making at household level were more likely to experience GBV than those who do. Women who have control over their spouses? earnings were less likely to suffer from GBV. However, ownership of property (land and/or house) was not associated with spousal GBV. Women who were in polygamous unions, whose spouses drank alcohol, earned less than their spouses and had a history of non-spousal physical violence were more likely to experience GBV than all other women. Younger women (aged 15-19 years) were more likely to experience spousal emotional, physical and sexual violence than the older age groups. Recommendations are to improve women?s participation in decision making, mainstreaming GBV in development, and improve the economic and social emancipation of women and girls. },

The analysis includes thirteen countries from five regions and compares their baseline survey scores. WEAI scores range from a high of 0.98 in Cambodia to a low of 0.66 in Bangladesh. Within Africa, West African countries have the lowest WEAI scores, followed by southern Africa with higher scores, and then East Africa, with the highest scores. These numbers provide an important measure of future progress, as baseline surveys for the remainder of Feed the Future countries are completed and additional rounds of data are collected during the midline and endline surveys.},

abstract = {Development programs that reduce gender gaps are expected to not only improve women's well-being, but also their children's. This draws on a growing body of literature that shows a strong positive association between women's status and control over resources and improvements in children's outcomes, particularly nutrition and education. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the relationship between empowerment gaps between men and women in the same household and children's well-being using nationally representative data from the 2012 Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS). We measure children's well-being using nutritional status for younger children (ages 0–5) and education outcomes for older children (ages 6–10 and 11–17). We measure relative empowerment using direct measures of empowerment collected from men and women in the same households using the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index. Our findings suggest that gender gaps in empowerment are only weakly linked to children's nutrition, although different measures of empowerment reveal significant differences between boys' and girls' outcomes, depending on the measures used. Overall, the household head's (father's) education is significantly associated with better nutrition and education outcomes for children, but younger girls (ages 6–10) and older boys and girls (ages 11–17) are more likely to receive more education when mothers are more educated. Our results on parental education suggest that fathers' empowerment may be reflecting a “wealth” effect that is invested in children's nutrition and education when they are young, while mothers' empowerment becomes more important in girls' education in general and keeping older children, regardless of sex, in school.},

abstract = {We describe distributed algorithms for two widely-used topic models, namely the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and the Hierarchical Dirichet Process (HDP) model. In our distributed algorithms the data is partitioned across separate processors and inference is done in a parallel, distributed fashion. We propose two distributed algorithms for LDA. The first algorithm is a straightforward mapping of LDA to a distributed processor setting. In this algorithm processors concurrently perform Gibbs sampling over local data followed by a global update of topic counts. The algorithm is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to Gibbs-sampled LDA. The second version is a model that uses a hierarchical Bayesian extension of LDA to directly account for distributed data. This model has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the first algorithm. Our distributed algorithm for HDP takes the straightforward mapping approach, and merges newly-created topics either by matching or by topic-id. Using five real-world text corpora we show that distributed learning works well in practice. For both LDA and HDP, we show that the converged test-data log probability for distributed learning is indistinguishable from that obtained with single-processor learning. Our extensive experimental results include learning topic models for two multi-million document collections using a 1024-processor parallel computer.},

abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services has become important for our understanding of the role of nature for maintaining human livelihoods. But is biodiversity essential to maintain ecosystem services? Many studies suggest that higher biodiversity allows a higher level of ecosystem services, but others argue that there is little hard evidence, especially from tropical environments, to document the necessity of high biodiversity for provision of most ecosystem services. Thus, effective valuation of biodiversity for ecosystem services and long-term studies and monitoring are needed to fully understand the complex biodiversity-ecosystem service interface. This introduction briefly reviews some of the main arguments in this debate and provides an overview of the other five special issue papers. Exploring biodiversity and ecosystem interactions in the context of the provision of ecosystem services, these papers address population and biodiversity coexistence, the importance of dung beetles in agricultural landscapes, the knowledge and use of palms by local communities, bioprospecting for drugs and how biodiversity conservation may have added benefits in terms of improved watershed functions and health.},

abstract = {Demographic data are important to wildlife managers to gauge population health, to allow populations to be utilised sustainably, and to inform conservation efforts. We analysed published demographic data on the world's wildfowl to examine taxonomic and geographic biases in study, and to identify gaps in knowledge. Wildfowl (order: Anseriformes) are a comparatively well studied bird group which includes 169 species of duck, goose and swan. In all, 1,586 wildfowl research papers published between 1911 and 2010 were found using Web of Knowledge (WoK) and Google Scholar. Over half of the research output involved just 15 species from seven genera. Research output was strongly biased towards 'high income' countries, common wildfowl species, and measures of productivity, rather than survival and movement patterns. There were significantly fewer demographic data for the world's 31 threatened wildfowl species than for non-threatened species. Since 1994, the volume of demographic work on threatened species has increased more than for nonthreatened species, but still makes up only 2.7{\%} of total research output. As an aid to research prioritisation, a metric was created to reflect demographic knowledge gaps for each species related to research output for the species, its threat status, and availability of potentially useful surrogate data from congeneric species. According to the metric, the 25 highest priority species include thirteen threatened taxa and nine species each from Asia and South America, and six from Africa.},

abstract = {In Nepal the practice of early marriage is common and is deeply rooted in the culture. The legal minimum age at marriage in Nepal is 18 with the guardian?s consent and 20 without the need for the guardian?s consent (the Muluki Ain, 2019 BS). In fact, however, most women have married at younger ages. For women age 25-49 the median age at first marriage was 17.5 years, and for men age 25-49 it was 21.6 years. Early marriage and resulting early sexual debut can lead to a number of potentially adverse outcomes, including unplanned pregnancy and exposure to sexually transmitted infections.  In Nepal the prevalence of HIV is estimated to be 0.3 percent in the general population age 15-49. According to the 2010 report of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS on the global AIDS epidemic, an estimated 64,000 adults and children in Nepal were living with HIV at the end of 2009 (up from 60,000 in 2001). Of these, 20,000 were women age 15 and  older. As in other developing countries, transmission of HIV in Nepal is driven by factors such as poverty, low literacy levels, low levels of condom use, cultural and religious factors, and stigma and discrimination. There are concentrated epidemics in certain high-risk populations in Nepal. Also, young people are particularly at risk. In 2011, only one-quarter of female youth and one-third of male youth age 15-24 had comprehensive knowledge of HIV and AIDS prevention.},

The latter describes a negotiated and contested fitness terrain. Individual and corporate actors simultaneously adapt to and actively manipulate this terrain by using alternative collective action frames, mobilizing resources, and creating or exploiting political opportunities in order to legitimate or delegitimate social structures and their associated technologies at various levels of analysis. Adaptation is conceptualized as occurring through homeostatic, developmental, rational choice, and populational mechanisms. Vulnerability results from the adaptive failure of social structures sustaining individual and collective health, livelihood, and well-being. This framework combines organizational sociologists' insights into structure–environment interaction; constructionists' attention to agency, language, culture, and values; and political ecologists' concerns with power, inequality, and processes of marginalization.},

For the more developed countries with presumably reliable abortion reporting, the first equation shows an extremely close fit. The principal predictor is the proportion of married women using modern methods of contraception. For less developed countries, other equations depend mainly on both modern method use and total fertility and are more questionable since reliable external estimates of abortion are less available. Estimates of abortion rates are nevertheless presented for a large number of less developed countries, based on recent data on contraceptive prevalence and fertility from a variety of sources. },

abstract = {In attempts to foster sustainable forest management practices, participation of local communities has become widely recognized as a better alternative than the traditional protectionist approach. This paper analyzed factors influencing local people's participation in forest management program in Sissili and Ziro provinces, southern Burkina Faso based on data collected through a household survey of 165 members of forest management groups using factor analysis and multiple regression. Factor analysis resulted in a three-factor solution, which accounted for 64.82{\%} of the total variance. Participation in decision-making, followed by participation in forest conservation and economic benefits were found to be the main factors influencing participation in the forest management program. Gender, household size, income source, land tenure status and technical assistance also appeared to influence members' participation in the program. The results indicate that participatory management program can be enhanced by changing the administrative structure of forest management groups in order to empower members in decision-making processes. In addition, increasing women's participation and more equitable benefit-sharing among user groups are essential in improving the success of the participatory forest management program. Thus, policies reforms to improve the structure of the forest management groups and to establish equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms are essential to improve the participation of local people in the forest management program and, hence, require immediate attention. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We augment the standard approach to explaining child nutrition outcomes by including information about household level agricultural production characteristics, including indicators of agricultural diversity. Data from the 2010/2011 Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS) are used in a series of regression models to explain stunting outcomes and variation in height-for-age Z-scores among 1,769 children 0–59 months of age. Results highlight the relative importance of overall agricultural yields, specific crop groups, and the consumption of own-production as factors correlated with long-term nutrition among children of different age groups. We find a small positive association between the degree of commercial market-orientation of households and child HAZ, but only among children under 24 months of age.},

abstract = {This paper explores the links between economic growth and the impacts of climate change. Inclusive, pro-poor growth is central to the development of low-income countries. There is also a broad consensus that growth and development are important to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Growth does not automatically reduce vulnerability, only the right kind of growth does. The paper aims to develop a better understanding of what the " right kind of growth " may be. We find that many growth policies, such as investment in skills and access to finance, indeed reduce vulnerability to climate change. However, climate change calls for some adjustments in growth policy. In particular, investment in infrastructure and efforts to stimulate entrepreneurship and competitive markets must take more of a risk management perspective and recognise climate risks.},

abstract = {In developing countries, forests play an important role in supplying goods and services. These ecosystems are under many stresses due to unsustainable management practices, lack of clarity on tenure and access rights, and persistent pressure for land-use change. Climate change is exacerbating the impact of these stresses on both forest ecosystems and forest dependent people. What are the current forest coping strategies of different livelihoods? What is the role of forest ecosystems in increasing the resilience of rural communities?Over a two-year period, an interdisciplinary team of civil society researchers and development practitioners made an attempt to address these questions in a systematic manner through the use of the CRiSTAL tool - Community-based Risk Screening Tool for Adaptation and Livelihoods - in different countries. For this publication, case studies conducted in three African countries -Zambia, Mali and Tanzania - are presented. Particular focus is given to the coping strategies used forest, livestock and agriculture based livelihoods. In all cases, forest ecosystems provided key goods and services during extreme events (droughts and floods) and become key assets for reducing vulnerability in the context of climate change However, issues related to unclear land tenure, as well as legislation forbidding forest use, strengthen underlying conflicts over natural resources and therefore increase the high pressure on forest ecosystems and thus the overall vulnerability of poor rural communities. This paper analyzes the corresponding challenges and offers a number of recommendations for decision- and policy-makers, on how to support local adaptation to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forests support the livelihoods of a vast number of people through subsistence use of products, such as food, fodder, and medicinal plants; cash income obtained from sale of products; and more indirect ecological benefits such as the contributions of forests and trees to agricultural productivity. It is widely acknowledged that these contributions can be paramount to local livelihoods, yet country- and region-wide data on their linkages remains sparse and limited attention has been devoted to understanding synergies and trade-offs between, for example, subsistence and cash exchange-based contributions. And because many forest landscapes are now transitioning towards patchworks of land uses owing to agricultural expansion, conservation interventions, urbanization, and other drivers, the ways in which forests support livelihoods are in flux leaving questions about potential shifts in their importance relatively unexplored. This editorial as well as the papers collected in this special issue on Forests, food, and livelihoods, discuss the ways in which forests contribute to livelihoods, including interactions between them, and how they change as landscapes transition. By doing so, we point to the need to move beyond single-year data collection to comparable temporal points and panel data as well as the importance of accounting for a) subsistence use values, b) commercial use values, and c) ecological forest contributions in poverty alleviation policies.},

abstract = {The second half of the twentieth century bore witness to significant declines in mortality among children in the developing world. Ghana was no exception, experiencing declines in mortality from the 1950s Onward. A series of Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in Ghana documented substantial improvements in infant and childhood mortality rates between 1988 and 1998. The results of the 2003 survey, however, indicated that these rates had plateaued at high levels. There was some concern that mortality might even be on the rise. The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the stagnation in the decline in childhood mortality in Ghana is real, to describe and evaluate trends in mortality, and to examine the key factors likely to influence mortality levels. This analysis suggests that the apparent uptick in mortality seen in the 2003 GDHS is largely a function of the underestimation of mortality in the previous survey. Thus, while there is no evidence to conclude that child mortality in Ghana is increasing, the past three Ghana DHS surveys provide substantial evidence that the decline in mortality in Ghana has stagnated at high levels. The trend data reviewed here suggest that there may be a continuing problem with children receiving adequate nourishment. There is also room for improvement in maternal and child health care indicators. Policies and programs designed to improve these indicators may help to facilitate the resumption of the downward trend in childhood mortality rates in Ghana.},

@book{Carolan2013,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 Michael Carolan. In this challenging work, the author argues that the goal of any food system should not simply be to provide the cheapest calories possible. A secure food system is one that affords people and nations – in both the present and future – the capabilities to prosper and lead long, happy, and healthy lives. For a variety of reasons, food security has come to be synonymous with cheap calorie security. On this measure, the last fifty years have been a remarkable success. But the author shows that these cheap calories have also come at great cost, to the environment, individual and societal well-being, human health, and the food sovereignty of nations. The book begins by reviewing the concept of food security, particularly as it has been enacted within agrifood and international policy over the last century. After proposing a coherent definition the author then assesses empirically whether these policies have actually made us and the environment any better off. One of the many ways the author accomplishes this task is by introducing the Food and Human Security Index (FHSI) in an original attempt to better measure and quantify the affording qualities of food systems. A FHSI score is calculated for 126 countries based on indicators of objective and subjective well-being, nutrition, ecological sustainability, food dependency, and food system market concentration. The final FHSI ranking produces many counter-intuitive results. Why, for example, does Costa Rica top the ranking, while the United States comes in at number fifty-five?. The author concludes by arguing for the need to reclaim food security by returning the concept to something akin to its original spirit, identified earlier in the book. While starting at the level of the farm the concluding chapter focuses most of its attention beyond the farm gate, recognizing that food security is more than just about issues surrounding production. For example, space is made in this chapter to address the important question of, “What can we eat if not GDP?” We need, the author contends, a thoroughly sociological rendering of food security: a position that views food security not as a thing – or an end in itself – but as a process that ought to make people and the Planet better off.},

We use the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) to elucidate how drivers in one country can affect ecosystem services and human well-being in other countries. We suggest that the concept of ecosystem services, as articulated by the MA, could be used as an organizing principle for transboundary conservation, because it meets many of the criteria for successful transboundary policy. It would frame conservation in terms of mutual interests between countries, consider a diversity of stakeholders, and provide a means for Unking multiple services and assessing tradeoffs between uses of services. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Background: Zimbabwe has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world, currently estimated at 15.2 percent among adults age 15-49. In 2009, voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) was adopted as an additional method of HIV prevention and since then has become a significant dimension of Zimbabwe?s HIV prevention strategy. The promotion of VMMC has raised a major concern that it might lead to an increase in high-risk sexual behavior, because circumcision could lead to a false sense of effective protection against HIV, a phenomenon known as risk compensation or behavioral disinhibition. According to the risk compensation hypothesis, as the risk of an undesirable outcome is reduced, people may compensate by behaving in riskier ways. In Zimbabwe, as in other countries with high HIV prevalence, male circumcision is  often promoted using evidence that it reduces the risk of HIV.  Purpose: This study sought to test whether circumcised men in Zimbabwe are more likely to have engaged in risky sexual behavior. The study also investigated the association among uncircumcised men between wanting male circumcision and engaging in high-risk sexual behavior.  Data and methods: The study used data collected from men age 15-54 who were interviewed during the 2010-11 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS). A total of 7,480 men were included in the sample for this study. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between circumcision and risky sexual behaviors.  Findings: The findings of this study do not support the risk compensation hypothesis. The study found no statistically significant association between male circumcision and risky sexual behavior. In contrast, the findings do show a strong association among uncircumcised men between wanting male circumcision and engaging in risky sexual behaviors.  Recommendations: Given the recency of the campaign to promote male circumcision in Zimbabwe, these results suggest a need to continue monitoring the relationships between ongoing VMCC campaigns and men?s risky sexual behavior. Communication and information dissemination on VMMC should emphasize caution in messages promoting medical male circumcision to avoid giving the impression that it provides immunity against HIV.},

abstract = {The Millennium Development Goals have increased international attention to child malnutrition in the developing world. Goal 1 aims to reduce hunger, and Goal 4 aims to reduce under-five child mortality. The study uses three key anthropometric measures of nutritional status among children?stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), and underweight (low weight for age)?to explore the dual effects of household composition and dependency on nutritional outcomes of children under age 5. The objectives are to examine changes in household living arrangements of under-five children and to explore the interaction of dependency and nucleation on child health outcomes.    The concept of nucleation, which is at the core of this paper, refers to the changing structure and composition of household living arrangements, from highly extended with its associated socioeconomic system of production and reproduction, social behavior and values, toward single-family households?especially the nuclear family, containing a husband and wife and their children alone. A negative relationship between levels of dependency, as measured by the number of children in the household, and child health outcomes is premised on the grounds that high dependency depletes resources, both tangible and intangible, to the disadvantage of young children.  Data for the study were drawn from the last four rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys (GDHS), from 1993 to 2008, for the first objective?to explore changes in household composition. For the second objective, to explore how dependency affects health outcomes of children under age 5, in the context of household composition, the study used data from the 2008 GDHS.  The results show that, over time, households in Ghana have been changing toward nucleation. The main finding is that in households with the same number of dependent children, in nucleated households children under age 5 have better health outcomes compared with children under age 5 in non-nucleated households. The results also indicate that the effect of dependency on child health outcomes is mediated by household nucleation and wealth status and that, as such, high levels of dependency do not necessarily translate into negative health outcomes for children under age 5, based on anthropometric measures.},

abstract = {Thousands of surveys on rural livelihoods in developing countries are being done every year. Unfortunately, many suffer from weaknesses in methods and problems in implementation. Quantifying households' dependence on multiple environmental resources (forests, bush, grasslands and rivers) is particularly difficult and often simply ignored in the surveys. The results therefore do not reflect rural realities. In particular, 'the hidden harvest' from natural resources is generally too important to livelihoods for development research, policies and practice to ignore. Fieldwork using state-of-the-art methods, and in particular well-designed household questionnaires, thus becomes an imperative to adequately capture key dimensions of rural welfare. This book describes how to do a better job when designing and implementing household and village surveys for quantitative assessment of rural livelihoods in developing countries. It covers the entire research process from planning to sharing research results. It draws on the experiences from a large global-comparative project, the Poverty Environment Network (PEN), to develop more robust and validated methods, enriched by numerous practical examples from the field. The book will provide an invaluable guide to methods and a practical handbook for students and professionals.},

Quality of care was measured in structure, process, and outcome of service provision. Associations between the outcome and structural and process attributes were analyzed using multiple regressions. Health facilities had inadequate infrastructure and supplies that are essential for providing good-quality services. Shortage of service-specific guidelines and infection prevention precautions was common across service areas and countries. Other structural inadequacies include the limited number of contraceptive methods provided by family planning facilities, little use of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guide in assessing and treating sick children, and poor availability of diagnosis tests to verify malaria for children under age 5. Although hospitals and health centers generally possessed better structural attributes than clinics and other lower-level health facilities, their performance in adhering to standards of care during service delivery was not necessarily superior, and sometimes was poorer than lower-level facilities. Long waiting time was a common problem across countries and services, and was more serious in hospitals and health centers than in clinics and other facilities. Long waiting time stands out for its consistent association with lower levels of client satisfaction. Our analysis also found evidence of more client satisfaction in the private sector than in the public sector.  },

This brief article discusses the various meanings attached to the concept and suggests that it can be a useful measure of household and individual welfare, particularly if combined with estimates of household food aquisition and allocation behavior. If nutritional security is the goal of interest, estimates of access to food should be combined with estimates of access to clean water and good sanitation. Anthrometric measures are likely to be more appropriate than food security estimates to target policies and programs to improved child nutrition.},

abstract = {This report evaluates the data quality of sibling survival history in DHS surveys and assesses its impact on maternal mortality estimates. The data are from 112 surveys conducted between 1990 and 2013; the surveys all included a sibling history module. We examined three aspects of data quality: completeness in sibling death reporting, completeness in reporting of all siblings and their age; and completeness in reporting of time of death during a calendar year and pregnancy status at the time of death. The overall quality of sibling history data is similar to the quality of data of individual women respondents in terms of age-misreporting. Reporting deaths in relation to pregnancy status and placing the deaths to calendar time remain major challenges for the respondents. The classification of maternal death relies on the reported timing of a sister?s death in relation to her pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum period. Many countries had very high non-response rates (10{\%}-40{\%}) for pregnancy status at the time of death, a situation that introduces substantial misclassification bias into identification of maternal deaths. DHS surveys currently report maternal mortality estimates without any adjustment for missing responses to timing of death. This may substantially underestimate the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and other maternal mortality indicators in countries with high non-response rates. Trend analysis, however, suggests that the missing responses have declined significantly in the recent rounds of DHS surveys. We recommend developing a standard protocol for handling missing data on maternal status at the time of death and adjusting maternal mortality estimates with an appropriate statistical method for handling missing data.       },

abstract = {This paper reviews the literature on African leafy vegetables (ALVs) consumed in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim is to evaluate the nutritional value of these plant species and their potential impact on the nutritional status of the people living in sub-Saharan Africa. Processing and the presence of antinutritional factors are taken into consideration as they adversely affect the nutritional content of the ALVs. The role of dietary fiber and other important components found in ALVs is also discussed due to their importance in the prevention of chronic and lifestyle diseases. Many of the ALVs are good sources of micronutrients, especially Manihot esculenta which contains 1970??g retinol equivalents/100. g edible portion and 311. mg/100. g of vitamin C, as well as Chenopodium album with up to 6. mg/100. g iron, 18.5. mg/100. g zinc, 226. mg/100. g calcium and up to 211. mg/100. g magnesium. These vegetables may help to meet daily requirements of these and other essential nutrients, especially in individuals with marginal nutritional status. Furthermore, ALVs such as Arachis hypogea and Bidens pilosa are good sources of dietary fibre, while Nasturtium aquatica, Urtic dioica and Xanthosoma mafaffa are excellent free radical scavengers. In many instances ALVs have levels of these components that are higher than those of exotic vegetables such as spinach and cabbage. Factors such as storage, cooking methods and drying influence the micronutrient, antioxidant and antinutritional factor content of these vegetables. The consumption, cultivation and possibly the commercialization of these ALVs should therefore be promoted. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures. Uncertainty remains in attributing the expansion or resurgence of diseases to climate change, owing to lack of long-term, high-quality data sets as well as the large influence of socio-economic factors and changes in immunity and drug resistance. Here we review the growing evidence that climate-health relationships pose increasing health risks under future projections of climate change and that the warming trend over recent decades has already contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in many regions of the world. Potentially vulnerable regions include the temperate latitudes, which are projected to warm disproportionately, the regions around the Pacific and Indian oceans that are currently subjected to large rainfall variability due to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation sub-Saharan Africa and sprawling cities where the urban heat island effect could intensify extreme climatic events.},

abstract = {Poverty and a generalized lack of economic opportunity in rural Nepal are believed to have served as both the spark and the fuel for the Maoist insurgency, which began in 1996. Political instability at the national level also contributed to the conflict: between 1990 and 2006, there were fifteen changes in government leadership. Despite this context of uncertainty, the economy grew from {\$}3.6 billion to over {\$}8 billion in current US dollars between 1990-2006. Additionally, remittances from migrant workers almost quadrupled between 1995-96 and 2003-04, increasing from {\$}203 million to {\$}794 million. At a time of violence and instability, this inflow of cash provided critical support to individual households and had a stabilizing effect on the economy as a whole.  However, such improvements at the national level may mask increasing economic inequalities in health and population outcomes. This report takes a closer look at the economic distribution of selected demographic and health outcomes during the period 1996-2006 using data from three Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys. Specifically, we use the DHS Wealth Index to assess changes in distributional equity in key outcomes over time. In addition to providing a descriptive analysis of such trends, we also use multivariate methods to analyze three selected health outcomes, with a particular focus on trends in the role of household economic status as a determinant of improved health outcomes.},

abstract = {Much of the population in the developing world resides in rural areas, is dependent on local agriculture for survival, and thus directly subject to increasingly volatile and variable climatic patterns. Poverty limits options for adaptation to unpredictable weather and resultant food insecurity; these concerns are particularly salient in an era of climate change, which threatens to roll back years of development gains. Examining the association between the growing environment and child survival and nutrition is important in this context. Using NASA's satellite remote sensing data with Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from four West African countries (Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Benin), we assess the association between a climate-related environmental variable (vegetation index - NDVI) and child survival and nutrition. NDVI had a positive association with child survival and nutrition in countries with a wide distribution of NDVI values. NDVI was more likely to be positively associated with wasting rather than stunting. We find that environmental factors can be important for child survival and nutrition outcomes in specific contexts. Additional research is needed to further explore the ways NDVI can be used to inform our understanding of the environment's impact on child survival and nutrition.},

Appropriate indicators of land-cover modifications need to be defined for semi-arid regions. Our hypothesis is that degradation can be measured by: (1) a decrease in the resilience of vegetation to droughts; (2) a decrease in rain-use efficiency; and (3) a modification of floristic composition. The objective of this paper is to test the relationships between a remotely sensed indicator of vegetation, rainfall data and field measurements of biomass and floristic composition. The study was based on field measurements of vegetation conditions covering a period of 10 years, in the semi-arid region of the Ferlo in Senegal. Our results indicate that land-cover modifications in the Ferlo are best measured by changes in rain-use efficiency. No consistent trend in the relative abundance of grass species was visible at the scale of the decade, even on the two sites affected by degradation. Just after a drought, a given increase in rainfall results in less biomass production than is the case for normal years.},

Beyond the usual considerations of omission of births and transference of births across questionnaire age boundaries, using data for only last-born children or non-last-born children instead of for all children born in the five years preceding the survey can result in biased research findings. Unfortunately, for certain child health outcomes, some DHS data are only collected for last-born children, and other data only for non-last-born. The correction of one bias may create another bias, as in the estimation of mortality risks by succeeding interval. Given the likely negative effects on the health and well-being of children whose birth is followed quickly by another birth, substantial efforts should be made to try to overcome these biases. },

abstract = {The contributions that non-timber forest products (NTFPs) can make to rural livelihoods, and the fact that their use is less ecologically destructive than timber harvesting, have encouraged the belief that more intensive management of forests for such products could contribute to both development and conservation objectives, and have led to initiatives to expand commercial use of NTFPs. This paper reviews evidence that indicates that this ‘conservation through commercialisation' thesis needs to be revised. In practice, the selective nature of market demand, and the uneven distribution of resources of use value within forests, mean that with NTFP harvesting the resource can become altered and degraded. The pressures that market forces can place on local control mechanisms, and the conflicting interests of those using forest resources for subsistence and income generation, can also result in poorer users becoming disadvantaged as NTFP commercialisation is intensified. An approach that recognises such areas of conflict, and attempts to arrive at a realistic balance between development and conservation, is proposed. {\textcopyright}},

Many hinterland farms remain largely self-sufficient, while farms closer to markets become increasingly specialized and linked to agribusinesses. Both semi-subsistence and commercialized farms remain family operations, with the few successful investor-owned farms found mainly for livestock and crops processed on site such as sugar, tea and oil palm. Meanwhile, demographic transition drives rapid change in farm sizes, with less land available per family until non-farm opportunities expand enough to absorb all new workers. Asia as a whole has now passed this turning point so its average farm sizes can rise, while in Africa average farm sizes will continue to fall for many years, posing special challenges in both hinterland and commercialized areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The decline of the total fertility rate (TFR) in Cambodia over the past decade, from 3.8 births per woman in 2000 to 3.0 in 2010, and the related changes in reproductive preferences is the focus of this further analysis of the three Cambodia Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Since the wanted total fertility rate (WTFR) declined only from 2.9 to 2.6 over these 10 years, most of the drop of actual fertility must lie in the reduction of unwanted births, through an increase in contraceptive prevalence and in use of abortion.  The factors found to be associated with the desired number of children include education, wealth, and the reduction of child mortality. Regional analyses clearly identify the capital city of Phnom Penh as having the greatest concentration of indicators of low fertility. Multivariate analyses of the number of children desired indicate covariates to include the actual number of children in the family as well as education, wealth, and child mortality. A multivariate analysis of current contraceptive use found the same covariates, along with exposure to television. Although there are data quality issues in the self-reporting of abortion, there seems to be clear evidence that abortion has increased over the decade. In general, the prospects of further increases in education and wealth, and in mass media exposure, along with continuing reductions of child mortality strongly suggest a continued decline of reproductive preferences and fertility in Cambodia.},

The authors argue that famine occurrences are linked to historical and contemporary socioeconomic processes that have increased over time the vulnerability of African households to hunger and reduced their resilience to environmental and economic shocks, political conflict, and the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS. Approaches to famine need to move away from the “emergency relief ” framework to better address the underlying conditions that make food shortages endemic. Future food security for Africa requires an integrated long-term response to household vulnerability on the part of African governments, civil society, and international partners by incorporating new technologies, local expertise, and active involvement of African communities living with the realities of recurrent famine.},

Our approach provides a global view of cellular chromatome under normal physiological conditions and enables the identification of chromatin-bound proteins de novo. Integrating Dm-ChP with genomic and functional data, we have discovered an unexpected chromatin function for adenosylhomocysteinase, a major one-carbon pathway metabolic enzyme, in gene activation. Our study reveals a new regulatory axis between the metabolic state of pluripotent cells, ribosomal protein production, and cell division during the early phase of embryo development, in which the metabolic flux of methylation reactions is favored in a local milieu.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a critical need to provide a better quantitative understanding of how the Sudano-Sahelian environments actually been changing under the combined impacts of climate variability and the increasing pressure of human activity. Using Corona, Landsat and SPOT satellite images of three areas (90-250 km2) along the climatic gradient of a large catchment in Mali, significant land-cover changes since the 1960s were identified through visual interpretation of images following a common classification scheme. The pattern and trajectory of changes differed markedly between the three areas studied. Overall, the 40-year trends indicate: (i) in the Sahelian area, a steady increase in croplands and erosional surfaces with sparse vegetation and a corresponding drastic reduction in woody covers; (ii) in the Sudano-Sahelian area, a large increase in croplands and a moderate reduction in woody covers; (iii) in the Sudanian area, agricultural extension, deforestation, but also reforestation and land rehabilitation, due to alternating periods of exploitation and recolonization by natural vegetation. These patterns and dynamics can be partially explained by the differences in demographic pressure between the three areas. They also highlight differences in response to anthropogenic and climate forcings depending on the areas' respective climatic and environmental endowments. This study is a first step towards an in-depth analysis of the various forces and processes driving these changes and the formulation of prospective environmental scenarios for the catchment in line with hydrological studies. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A major challenge for ecologists has long been to develop a model to explain the coexistence of grasses and trees in the savanna. The recent shift in emphasis to non-equilibrium-based theories has resulted in a rethinking of this problem. As resource allocation models have been replaced by demographic ones, the focus has shifted to plant life histories. The tree/grass ratio is now conceptualized as a function of disturbance history. Empirical studies demonstrate that repeat fires trap tree sprouts in perpetual juvenile states. Ecologists suggest natural pathways for juveniles to escape, reach maturity, and maintain tree/grass ratios. This study documents how long-fallow agriculture serves as an anthropogenic pathway. The study compares tree cover on long-fallow and unfarmed savanna plots in southern Mali where burning is annual. Tree height, girth, and species were recorded for 29 quadrats. The results demonstrate a significant difference in the size, number, and species of trees; those on fallow plots were taller, more numerous, and more diverse. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Poor households access their food from the market, subsistence production and transfers from public programmes or other households. In the past rural households produced most of their own food, but recent studies have shown an increase in dependence on market purchases by both urban and rural households, in some cases reaching 90{\%} of the food supplies. Food expenditures can account for as much as 60-80{\%} of total household income for low-income households in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Subsistence/smallholder agriculture can play an important role in reducing the vulnerability of rural and urban food-insecure households, improving livelihoods, and helping to mitigate high food price inflation. There is a need to significantly increase the productivity of subsistence/smallholder agriculture and ensure long-term food security. This can be achieved by encouraging farmers to pursue sustainable intensification of production through the use of improved inputs. This will require a dramatic increase in the use of fertiliser, organic inputs and conservation investments, combined with the development of well-functioning input and output markets to help farmers acquire and use improved inputs, market their (surplus) output and reduce transaction costs and risks. Increased productivity will reduce pressure on marginal lands, as the intensification of cultivated land will reduce pressure to crop fragile marginal lands. There is a need to determine methods of identifying cost-effective ways to improve access to inputs by, among other things, improving delivery, and assisting farmers to earn cash to purchase inputs and invest in infrastructure, thereby improving food security.},

abstract = {Introduction: In many countries different interventions have been implemented to prevent new infections of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Rwanda has developed and implemented many strategies at the national level to reduce the incidence of HIV in the general population. One of the main objectives of such interventions is to improve the general  level of knowledge of HIV, with the hypothesis that increasing HIV knowledge will reduce risky sexual behavior. However, there has been a concern that HIV knowledge may not necessarily reduce risky sexual behavior. Only a limited number of population-based studies describe the results of these interventions in terms of how HIV knowledge affects risky sexual behavior. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to fill in this gap, by exploring HIV knowledge and its effect on risky sexual behavior among men in Rwanda.  Methods: The study used data from the 2005 and 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys to analyze the association between HIV risk factors and two types of risky sexual behavior?having two or more partners in the past 12 months; and among those with two or more partners, not using a condom at last sex)?and the association between HIV knowledge and those risky behaviors. In addition to descriptive and bivariate analyses, multivariate logistic regression on pooled data from 2005 and 2010 was used to determine predictors of risky sexual behavior.  Results: Among men in the study sample, 5{\%} in 2005 and 7{\%} in 2010 reported having two or more sexual partners in the last 12 months preceding the survey. Among these men, 93{\%} in 2005 and 74{\%} in 2010 did not use a condom at the last sex. Knowledge of the protective effect of having just one uninfected faithful partner decreased from 90{\%} to 82{\%} between 2005 and 2010, and basic knowledge of HIV decreased from 71{\%} in 2005 to 68{\%} in 2010. Knowledge of the protective effect of using condoms increased from 90{\%} in 2005 to 94{\%} in 2010. In adjusted multivariate analysis, HIV knowledge was not associated with either type of risky sexual behavior.  Conclusion: The findings suggest that, while knowledge of the protective effect of using condoms has increased, knowledge of the protective effect of one uninfected faithful partner has been decreasing in Rwanda. This should draw attention to the need to take corrective measures. The study did not find strong evidence of a significant association between HIV knowledge and risky sexual behavior among men in Rwanda. In setting up policies and strategies related to HIV prevention, policymakers should consider that focusing on HIV knowledge is not sufficient in itself.},

Furthermore, the data are analysed with an advanced statistical technique - segmented regression analysis - which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: (1) The number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters) per publication year and (2) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We have looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis of cited references we identified three growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1{\%} up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3{\%} up to the period between the two world wars and 8 to 9{\%} to 2012.},

abstract = {This report examines the prevalence of current cigarette smoking and tobacco use among women and men in 49 developing countries. Data for the analysis were obtained from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 1999 and 2010. The report describes the proportion of women and men age 15-49 within the countries who report currently using manufactured cigarettes, other forms of smoked tobacco, and smokeless tobacco. The study also explores differentials in cigarette smoking by selected sociodemographic characteristics. The prevalence of any tobacco use varies substantially worldwide for women and men. For men, the prevalence of any tobacco use exceeds 40 percent in all the countries examined in North Africa/West Asia/Europe, Central Asia, and South and Southeast Asia. Timor-Leste has the highest prevalence of tobacco use for men, with 7 out of 10 men currently using at least one form of tobacco. Lower prevalence of tobacco use for men is generally found in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America/Caribbean. Women are much less likely than men to report using tobacco in all the countries with available data. The highest prevalence of tobacco use for women is found in Madagascar (21 percent), Nepal (20 percent), and Ukraine (15 percent). The results show significant variation in the prevalence of cigarette smoking for women and men by age, marital status, level of education, urban-rural area, employment and cash earnings (women only), occupation (men only), household wealth, maternity status, exposure to mass media, and migration status (men only). },

abstract = {In West Africa, agriculture, mainly rainfed, is a major economic sector and the one most vulnerable to climate change. A meta-database of future crop yields, built up from 16 recent studies, is used to provide an overall assessment of the potential impact of climate change on yields, and to analyze sources of uncertainty.Despite a large dispersion of yield changes ranging from -50{\%} to +90{\%}, the median is a yield loss near -11{\%}. This negative impact is assessed by both empirical and process-based crop models whereas the Ricardian approach gives very contrasted results, even within a single study. The predicted impact is larger in northern West Africa (Sudano-Sahelian countries, -18{\%} median response) than in southern West Africa (Guinean countries, -13{\%}) which is likely due to drier and warmer projections in the northern part of West Africa. Moreover, negative impacts on crop productivity increase in severity as warming intensifies, with a median yield loss near -15{\%} with most intense warming, highlighting the importance of global warming mitigation.The consistently negative impact of climate change results mainly from the temperature whose increase projected by climate models is much larger relative to precipitation change. However, rainfall changes, still uncertain in climate projections, have the potential to exacerbate or mitigate this impact depending on whether rainfall decreases or increases. Finally, results highlight the pivotal role that the carbon fertilization effect may have on the sign and amplitude of change in crop yields. This effect is particularly strong for a high carbon dioxide concentration scenario and for C3 crops (e.g. soybean, cassava). As staple crops are mainly C4 (e.g. maize, millet, sorghum) in WA, this positive effect is less significant for the region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, the collection of accurate income and consumption data requires extensive resources for household surveys. Given the increasingly routine application of principal components analysis (PCA) using asset data in creating socio-economic status (SES) indices, we review how PCA-based indices are constructed, how they can be used, and their validity and limitations. Specifically, issues related to choice of variables, data preparation and problems such as data clustering are addressed. Interpretation of results and methods of classifying households into SES groups are also discussed. PCA has been validated as a method to describe SES differentiation within a population. Issues related to the underlying data will affect PCA and this should be considered when generating and interpreting results.},

abstract = {Understanding women's influence on plant biodiversity is essential to our ability to conserve plant genetic resources, especially those plants that are useful to humans. Contrary to previous thinking, it is becoming clear that women know most about these plants because, throughout history, women's daily work has required more of this knowledge. This paper describes how women predominate in plant biodiversity management in their roles as housewives, plant gatherers, homegardeners, herbalists, seed custo- dians and informal plant breeders. But because most plant use, management and conservation occurs within the domestic realm, and because the principal values of plant genetic resources are localised and non-monetary, they are largely invisible to outsiders and are easily undervalued. Gender bias has prevailed in scientific research about people-plant relationships, and conservation policies and programmes are still largely blind to the importance of the domestic sphere, of women and of gender relations for biodiversity conservation, and to the importance of plant biodiversity for women's status and welfare. Traditional knowledge and indigenous rights to plants are everywhere sex-differentiated, and gender inequalities are also impli- cated in processes leading to biological erosion. Achieving the goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity, particularly those related to sustainable use and to benefit sharing, will require much greater atten- tion to women's knowledge, management and rights, and to the domestic sphere. Examples of positive steps needed include: prioritising the conservation of plants that are important to women curators and reversing dynamics that lead to their erosion; recognising, valuing and promoting the inter-generational transmission of women's traditional knowledge and practices; recognising indigenous rights systems and, within these, women's rights to plants and land resources that sustain these plants; ensuring women's full participation in decisions and policies that affect their plant rights and the status and welfare that they derive from plant resources; and promoting and disseminating research that enhances our knowledge of the above.},

abstract = {Under the current scenario of rapid human population increase, achieving efficient and productive agricultural land use while conserving biodiversity is a global challenge. There is an ongoing debate whether land for nature and for production should be segregated (land sparing) or integrated on the same land (land sharing, wildlife-friendly farming). While recent studies argue for agricultural intensification in a land sparing approach, we suggest here that it fails to account for real-world complexity. We argue that agriculture practiced under smallholder farmer-dominated landscapes and not large-scale farming, is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world. Furthermore, contemporary food usage is inefficient with one third wasted and a further third used inefficiently to feed livestock and that conventional intensification causes often overlooked environmental costs. A major argument for wildlife friendly farming and agroecological intensification is that crucial ecosystem services are provided by " planned" and " associated" biodiversity, whereas the land sparing concept implies that biodiversity in agroecosystems is functionally negligible. However, loss of biological control can result in dramatic increases of pest densities, pollinator services affect a third of global human food supply, and inappropriate agricultural management can lead to environmental degradation. Hence, the true value of functional biodiversity on the farm is often inadequately acknowledged or understood, while conventional intensification tends to disrupt beneficial functions of biodiversity. In conclusion, linking agricultural intensification with biodiversity conservation and hunger reduction requires well-informed regional and targeted solutions, something which the land sparing vs sharing debate has failed to achieve so far. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A stall occurred in the decline of fertility in Kenya between 1998 and 2003. The fertility rate had been declining and contraceptive prevalence had been increasing for a quarter of a century. This unexpected interruption of an established trend is the focus of this inquiry. The stall or reversal of the fertility decline is seen throughout the country but is particularly evident among the least educated women. The stall in contraceptive prevalence is seen mainly among younger women and among those with less education. The use of oral contraceptives, the IUD, and sterilization declined over the preceding decade while the use of injectables increased. A finding of particular interest is that while use of contraception among all women remained constant between 1998 and 2003, the expected increase did occur among sexually active women, regardless of marital status. Another factor underlying the stall in the increase in contraceptive prevalence and the decrease in fertility is the observed decline in the proportion of women who want no more children, a marked departure from the steady increase in this variable since 1977. A similar change is seen among men. Although the analysis has identified the demographic dynamics of the stall in the fertility transition in Kenya, a full explanation is lacking. Shortages of contraceptive supplies have probably played some role but this does not explain the increase in the proportion of women who want more children. },

The "lasso" minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) addresses the challenge of meeting the growing demand for food, fibre and fuel, despite the changing climate and fewer opportunities for agricultural expansion on additional lands. CSA focuses on contributing to economic development, poverty reduction and food security; maintaining and enhancing the productivity and resilience of natural and agricultural ecosystem functions, thus building natural capital; and reducing trade-offs involved in meeting these goals. Current gaps in knowledge, work within CSA, and agendas for interdisciplinary research and science-based actions identified at the 2013 Global Science Conference on Climate-Smart Agriculture (Davis, CA, USA) are described here within three themes: (1) farm and food systems, (2) landscape and regional issues and (3) institutional and policy aspects. The first two themes comprise crop physiology and genetics, mitigation and adaptation for livestock and agriculture, barriers to adoption of CSA practices, climate risk management and energy and biofuels (theme 1); and modelling adaptation and uncertainty, achieving multifunctionality, food and fishery systems, forest biodiversity and ecosystem services, rural migration from climate change and metrics (theme 2). Theme 3 comprises designing research that bridges disciplines, integrating stakeholder input to directly link science, action and governance. OUTCOMES: In addition to interdisciplinary research among these themes, imperatives include developing (1) models that include adaptation and transformation at either the farm or landscape level; (2) capacity approaches to examine multifunctional solutions for agronomic, ecological and socioeconomic challenges; (3) scenarios that are validated by direct evidence and metrics to support behaviours that foster resilience and natural capital; (4) reductions in the risk that can present formidable barriers for farmers during adoption of new technology and practices; and (5) an understanding of how climate affects the rural labour force, land tenure and cultural integrity, and thus the stability of food production. Effective work in CSA will involve stakeholders, address governance issues, examine uncertainties, incorporate social benefits with technological change, and establish climate finance within a green development framework. Here, the socioecological approach is intended to reduce development controversies associated with CSA and to identify technologies, policies and approaches leading to sustainable food production and consumption patterns in a changing climate.},

abstract = {This paper hypothesizes that there is a common core to the household food insecurity experience that goes beyond insufficient food quantity and that transcends culture. The paper for the first time employs an exploratory approach to identify cross-cultural commonalities of the food insecurity experience as captured in 22 scales and related ethnographies derived from 15 different countries. The constant comparative method was used to code elements of the food insecurity experience expressed in the ethnographies and to regroup them into domains and subdomains. This typology was then applied to ascertain which experiential domains and subdomains were measured (or not) across all 22 studies. Survey data from 11 of the studies were then analyzed to assess similarities in the relative frequency with which culturally diverse households responded to questionnaire items related to these common domains/subdomains. The analysis confirmed that insufficient food quantity, inadequate food quality, and uncertainty and worry about food were a significant part of the food insecurity experience in all sampled cultures; concerns about social unacceptability emerged in all ethnographic accounts. Several subdomains were identified, such as concern over food safety and meal pattern disruption, with potentially important consequences for physical and psychological well-being. The comparative survey data showed that the relative frequency at which populations responded to domain- related questionnaire items was similar across all but a few cultures. Future food insecurity assessments should consider these core domains and subdomains as the starting point for measures that can generate rich information to inform food security policies and programs.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

These changes, including population movement and increased disparities between poor and rich households, are associated with demographic and health outcomes for the population. Policy changes also produced measurable impacts on health and demographic outcomes. Many of the trends between the 2000 and 2005 ADHS surveys reflect the impact of considerable population movement. For example, in Armenia as a whole, children are nearly three times more likely to have a non-coresident father in 2005 as they were in 2000. In the same vein, the proportion of currently in-union mothers without a husband coresident has increased. This absence of husbands is related to the decrease in contraceptive use since 2000: the proportion of discontinuations ascribed to infrequent sex or husband absence doubled over the five-year period.},

It runs a comparison between the three villages and shows that there is a positive relationship between rainfall shortage and out-migration, after taking other important demographic and socio- economic factors into account, such as age, wealth and education. The article further argues that the mechanism through which rainfall variability affects human mobility in the research site is food insecurity for humans and livestock. Keywords:},

abstract = {Win-win solutions that both conserve biodiversity and promote human well-being are difficult to realize. Trade-offs and the hard choices they entail are the norm. Since 2008, the Advancing Conservation in a Social Context (ACSC) research initiative has been investigating the complex trade-offs that exist between human well-being and biodiversity conservation goals, and between conservation and other economic, political and social agendas across multiple scales. Resolving trade-offs is difficult because social problems - of which conservation is one - can be perceived and understood in a variety of disparate ways, influenced (in part at least) by how people are raised and educated, their life experiences, and the options they have faced. Pre-existing assumptions about the "right" approach to conservation often obscure important differences in both power and understanding, and can limit the success of policy and programmatic interventions. The new conservation debate challenges conservationists to be explicit about losses, costs, and hard choices so they can be openly discussed and honestly negotiated. Not to do so can lead to unrealized expectations, and ultimately to unresolved conflict. This paper explores the background and limitations of win-win approaches to conservation and human well-being, discusses the prospect of approaching conservation challenges in terms of trade-offs and hard choices, and presents a set of guiding principles that can serve to orient strategic analysis and communication regarding trade-offs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Reserves alone are not adequate for nature conservation but they are the cornerstone on which regional strategies are built. Reserves have two main roles. They should sample or represent the biodiversity of each region and they should separate this biodiversity from processes that threaten its persistence. Existing reserve systems throughout the world contain a biased sample of biodiversity, usually that of remote places and other areas that are unsuitable for commercial activities. A more systematic approach to locating and designing reserves has been evolving and this approach will need to be implemented if a large proportion of today's biodiversity is to exist in a future of increasing numbers of people and their demands on natural resources.},

abstract = {Soil moisture can be estimated at coarse resolutions ({\textgreater}1 km) using satellite remote sensing, but that resolution is poorly suited for many applications. The Equilibrium Moisture from Topography, Vegetation, and Soil (EMT1VS) model downscales coarse-resolution soil moisture using fine-resolution topographic, vegetation, and soil data to produce fine-resolution (10–30 m) estimates of soil moisture. The EMT1VS model performs well at catchments with low topographic relief (?124 m), but it has not been applied to regions with larger ranges of elevation. Large relief can produce substantial variations in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET), which might affect the fine-resolution patterns of soil moisture. In this research, simple methods to downscale temporal average precipitation and PET are developed and included in the EMT1VS model, and the effects of spatial variations in these variables on the surface soil moisture estimates are investigated. The methods are tested against ground truth data at the 239 km2 Reynolds Creek watershed in southern Idaho, which has 1145 m of relief. The precipitation and PET downscaling methods are able to capture the main features in the spatial patterns of both variables. The space-time Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of efficiency of the fine-resolution soil moisture estimates improve from 0.33 to 0.36 and 0.41 when the precipitation and PET downscaling methods are included, respectively. PET downscaling provides a larger improvement in the soil moisture estimates than precipitation. downscaling likely because the PET pattern is more persistent through time, and thus more predictable, than the precipitation pattern},

Field surveys conducted in 1998-2001 indicated that environmental and agricultural conditions have improved in the past decade. In an effort to better quantify environmental trends, we conducted a study using medium- and high-resolution remotely sensed images from 1965 to 2001 in order to analyze land use and land cover trends in 21 village territories. The trends show clear indications of agricultural intensification and diversification among villages that have received assistance from the OHVN agricultural development agency. Some communities have improved environmental conditions by protecting their forest resources through community management actions. Four decades of remotely sensed images played a practical role in tracking and quantifying environmental and agricultural conditions over time.},

abstract = {In this report, using data from 99 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 36 sub-Saharan African countries, we investigate factors that have contributed to the declines in under-five mortality rates (U5MR) in sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, we focus on the extent to which changes in country-level economic growth and changes in the coverage of key maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) interventions have contributed to reductions in under-five mortality.. Our results show that changes in country-level per capita GDP (pcGDP) are not consistently associated with a reduction in U5MR across different model specifications. In ecological time series models, a unit increase in pcGDP is associated with a reduction in U5MRof 11.6 deaths per 1000 live births (95{\%} CI: -29.1, 5.9), while a composite index of MNCH interventions is associated with a reduction in U5MR of 31.9 deaths per 1000 live births (95{\%} CI: -48.6, -15.3). The results of the multilevel repeated cross-section data structure suggest that MNCH coverage indicators are important. For example, pcGDP is associated for a decreased likelihood of child mortality with an odds ratio of 0.96 (95{\%} CI: 0.92 -1.00) and an increase of 1 standard deviation in the composite coverage index (CCI) is also associated with a decrease in child mortality [odds ratio 0.92 (95{\%} CI: 0.88 - 0.96)]. A measure of improvements in sanitary facilities is associated with an odds ratio of 0.57 (95{\%} CI: 0.50-0.65) for child mortality. },

However, rapidly expanding programs for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission hold promise for greatly reducing the number of new pediatric HIV infections and improving the survival of children of HIV-positive women.  This report presents the results of a bivariate analysis of data from 20 surveys in 13 countries conducted under the DHS Program between 2003 and 2012 in order to compare the levels of child mortality among children of HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, and to explore changes over time. Across all surveys in the analysis, children of HIV-positive women generally experience higher mortality rates than children of HIV-negative women. In 17 of 20 surveys studied, children of HIV-positive women have significantly higher under-five mortality rates than children of HIV-negative women.  The relative risks range from 1.5 in the 2011 Cameroon DHS to 3.6 in the 2006 Swaziland DHS.

abstract = {Understanding the causes of economic inequality is critical for achieving equitable economic development. To investigate whether global warming has affected the recent evolution of inequality, we combine counterfactual historical temperature trajectories from a suite of global climate models with extensively replicated empirical evidence of the relationship between historical temperature fluctuations and economic growth. Together, these allow us to generate probabilistic country-level estimates of the influence of anthropogenic climate forcing on historical economic output. We find very high likelihood that anthropogenic climate forcing has increased economic inequality between countries. For example, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) has been reduced 17–31{\%} at the poorest four deciles of the population-weighted country-level per capita GDP distribution, yielding a ratio between the top and bottom deciles that is 25{\%} larger than in a world without global warming. As a result, although between-country inequality has decreased over the past half century, there is ∼90{\%} likelihood that global warming has slowed that decrease. The primary driver is the parabolic relationship between temperature and economic growth, with warming increasing growth in cool countries and decreasing growth in warm countries. Although there is uncertainty in whether historical warming has benefited some temperate, rich countries, for most poor countries there is {\textgreater}90{\%} likelihood that per capita GDP is lower today than if global warming had not occurred. Thus, our results show that, in addition to not sharing equally in the direct benefits of fossil fuel use, many poor countries have been significantly harmed by the warming arising from wealthy countries' energy consumption.},

The paper employs property rights based framework coupled with some New Institutional Economics (NIE) debates as a diagnostic framework for understanding forest property rights. The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) provides empirically insights into how "forest institutional property rights" impact on forest communities' livelihoods and management. Our analysis provides support for the argument that forest institutional property rights play important role in the livelihoods of forest dependent communities and in forest management, but that can be context specific as showcased in our findings.

abstract = {Many claims have been made concerning the use of NTFPs as part of development and conservation strategies. Important amongst these is that because NTFPs play an important part in household incomes they can be used to raise the perceived value of forests and thus provide incentives for more sustainable use of the forest estate. However, migrant communities living around forest margins have often been perceived as groups of people most likely to take advantage of the free goods provided by forests in a way that degrades the forest environment as short term benefits are maximised over long-term sustainability. Empirical evidence from the forest zone of south-west Cameroon suggests that for many migrant communities NTFPs are not a significant part (no more than 6{\%}) of household total income and that poorer groups seek diverse livelihood strategies that are not predicated on natural resource use. Whilst richer groups may continue to rely on sources of income from the forest and NTFPs may make up to 15{\%} of household income, for rich and poor alike the value derived from NTFPs is generated by secondary forest and forest fallow rather than less disturbed forest that has been the focus of conservation interest. The view is put forward that forest managers and international donors interested in conservation and development need to reassess the potential contribution of NTFPs in poverty alleviation strategies, and acknowledge that forest conservation priorities of local communities require policies and management systems focused on `sustainable systems for production of livelihood benefits' rather than protectionist approaches to areas traditionally defined as valuable forest.},

Increasing the resilience of nutrition and food security outcomes is especially critical throughout agrarian parts of the developing world, where human subsistence and well-being are directly affected by local rainfall. In this study, we use data from Feed the Future datasets from Ghana, Zambia, and Bangladesh to examine the impact of precipitation extremes on food security as well as the role of natural land cover and women's empowerment in creating resilience. We first model the effects of extreme rainfall on indicators of nutrition and food security, and then examine whether women's empowerment and environmental land cover types can dampen the effects of rainfall shocks on these food security and nutrition outcomes. Our results find that there is a strong association between extreme precipitation and household hunger. Further, they suggest that in certain contexts land cover types providing ecosystem services can reduce household hunger scores, that empowering women can mitigate the effects of precipitation shocks, and that there may be an interactive effect between ecosystem service availability and women's empowerment.},

We extracted information for individuals with insurance       claims suggestive of epilepsy.  Using iterative expert classification,        we sorted patients by type of epilepsy.  For each type we calculated       prevalence and HRU.  A distance analysis identified closely similar       types,  and a principal components analysis revealed dimensions of       variation in HRU.       RESULTS: The prevalence of active epilepsy was 3.4  per 1,000.  Most       common diagnoses among 46,847  patients were generalized convulsive       epilepsy (33.3{\%})  and complex partial seizures (24.8{\%}).  Patients       averaged 10 physician visits per year,  24 diagnostic tests/procedures       per year,  {\textgreater}30 drug dispensings per year,  and {\textless}1 emergency room (ER)       visit per year,  the minority of each of these being related to       epilepsy.  Female patients generally had more HRU,  and HRU increased       with age.  Patients were hospitalized most frequently for disorders       other than epilepsy.  HRU was similar for most epilepsy types,        excepting grand mal status,  epilepsia partialis continua,  and       infantile spasms.  The first principal components of HRU variation was       nonepilepsy HRU,  followed by components of epilepsy-related       medications,  other epilepsy/emergency care,  and epilepsy       visits/diagnostic procedures.       CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of active epilepsy in the United States is       substantially less than the prevalence of any history of recurrent       seizure.  Nonepilepsy-related HRU dominated HRU in epilepsy patients and       was the principal source of variation.  There is a core set of epilepsy       diagnoses,  the HRU patterns of which are indistinguishable,  whereas       patients with grand mal status,  epilepsia partialis continua,  and       infantile spasms all have distinct patterns.  To provide more specific       insights into the economic impact of the condition,  studies of HRU in       epilepsy should make a distinction about epilepsy-related and unrelated       care.},

First, the impacts on water quality of resources (rivers and lakes) modifying parameters values (physico-chemical parameters, micropollutants and biological parameters) are consid-ered. Then, the expected impacts on drinking water production and quality of supplied water are discussed. The main conclusion which can be drawn is that a degradation trend of drinking water quality in the context of climate change leads to an increase of at risk situations related to potential health impact.},

abstract = {The relationship between forests and human nutrition is not yet well understood. A better understanding of this relationship is vital at a time when the majority of new land for agriculture is being cleared from forests. We use Demographic Health Survey data on food consumption for children from 21 African countries and Global Land Cover Facility tree cover data to examine the relationship between tree cover and three key indicators of nutritional quality of children's diets: dietary diversity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and animal source food consumption. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: there is a statistically significant positive relationship between tree cover and dietary diversity; fruit and vegetable consumption increases with tree cover until a peak of 45{\%} tree cover and then declines; and there is no relationship between animal source food consumption and tree cover. Overall our findings suggest that children in Africa who live in areas with more tree cover have more diverse and nutritious diets. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

This paper considers the rationale for continuous DHS surveys, reviews key elements in the initial Peru CS survey design, and describes how the Peru CS evolved over time, particularly in response to demands for subnational data. In reviewing the Peru experience, the paper also identifies some strengths and weaknesses of the CS model and highlights factors that were crucial in enabling Peru to successfully implement a continuous DHS for more than a decade. },

abstract = {The main objectives of this paper are: (1) to elucidate key definitions and concepts of sustainability, including the Brundtland definition, the triple bottom line, weak and strong sustainability, resilience, human well-being, and ecosystem services; (2) to examine key definitions and concepts of landscape sustainability, including those derived from general concepts and those developed for specific landscapes; and (3) to propose a framework for developing a science of landscape sustainability. Landscape sustainability is defined as the capacity of a landscape to consistently provide long-term, landscape-specific ecosystem services essential for maintaining and improving human well-being. Fundamentally, well-being is a journey, not a destination. Landscape sustainability science is a place-based, use-inspired science of understanding and improving the dynamic relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being in changing landscapes under uncertainties arising from internal feedbacks and external disturbances. While landscape sustainability science emphasizes place-based research on landscape and regional scales, significant between landscape interactions and hierarchical linkages to both finer and broader scales (or externalities) must not be ignored. To advance landscape sustainability science, spatially explicit methods are essential, especially experimental approaches that take advantage of designed landscapes and multi-scaled simulation models that couple the dynamics of landscape services (ecosystem services provided by multiple landscape elements in combination as emergent properties) and human well-being.},

abstract = {Biodiversity persistence in human-modified landscapes is crucial for conservation and maintaining ecosystem services. Studies of biodiversity in landscapes where humans live, work, and extract resources could support defensible policy-making to manage land-use. Yet, research should cover relevant regions, and biases in study topics should not lead to gaps in the evidence base.We systematically reviewed the literature of biogeography in human-modified landscapes published in eight eminent biogeography, conservation, and ecology journals to assess geographical bias among biomes and geopolitical regions and taxonomic bias among species groups.We compared research output per biome to area, biome type, species richness, proportion of transformed land, and the ratio of transformed to protected land. We also compared research output per geopolitical region to area, proportion of transformed land, the ratio of transformed to protected land, and human population density. Research output was distributed unequally among biomes, geopolitical regions, and species groups. Biome type was a clear factor in research bias, and forest biomes were the subject of 87{\%} of papers, while species richness was not generally associated with bias. Conservation in human-modified landscapes is most important in regions with low protected area coverage, high land conversion, and high pressure from human populations, yet the distribution of published papers did not generally reflect these threats. Seventy-five percent of studies focused on the Americas and Europe, while Africa and Asia were critically understudied. Taxonomically, plants and invertebrates were the most studied groups; however, research output was not correlated with species richness per group. Protected areas alone will not conserve biodiversity in the long term. Thus, a strong biogeographical evidence base is required to support policies for biodiversity maintenance on human-modified land. Under-studied regions and species groups deserve further research to elucidate what, where, and how biodiversity persists in human-modified landscapes to inform},

abstract = {The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) is carried out periodically to provide a wide variety of household-level information on health and fertility for Nepal. A nationally representative sample of 10,793 women ages 15-49 was surveyed from 8,707 households throughout Nepal. The women interviewed were asked whether their children younger than five years had diarrhea, fever, or cough in the two weeks prior to the survey. If so, then they were asked a series of questions about the symptoms, whether and where they sought treatment for the illness, and what treatment was given. Similar questions on childhood illness were asked in the 2001 and 1996 NDHS surveys, and they are referenced in this paper for comparison purposes. This paper focuses on additional data that was not analyzed as part of the overall 2006 NDHS final results. Two questions were added to the 2006 NDHS that were not included in earlier DHS surveys in Nepal. The first was whether a child for whom the source of care was ?pharmacy? had been examined, and if not, whether the caretaker had received advice about what to give the child. The second question was whether the child was taken to a female Community Health Volunteer (FCHV). Both of these issues have programmatic implications regarding the nature of providers for childhood illness in Nepal. Finally, this working paper looks at the type of treatment by provider to provide further insight into provider behavior and possible gaps in coverage. },

abstract = {AbstractWe analyse whether Tanzanian rural households engage in internal migration as a response to weather-related shocks. We hypothesise that, when exposed to such shocks and a consecutive crop yield reduction, rural households use migration as a risk management strategy. Our findings confirm that for an average household, a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural income induced by weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average within the following year. However, this effect is significant only for households in the middle of wealth distribution, suggesting that the choice of migration as an adaptation strategy depends on initial endowment. What is more, the proposed mechanism applies to households whose income is highly dependent on agriculture, but is not important for diversified livelihoods.},

abstract = {Conversion of forested lands to agriculture or urban/residential areas has been associated with declines in stream and lake water quality. Less attention has been paid to the effects of adjacent land-uses on wetland sediment and water quality and, perhaps more importantly, the spatial scales at which these effects occur. Here we address these issues by examining variation in water and sediment nutrient levels in 73 southeastern Ontario, Canada, wetlands. We modeled the relationship between water and sediment nutrient concentrations and various measures of adjacent land-use such as forest cover and road density, measured over increasing distances from the wetland edge. We found that water nitrogen and phosphorous levels were negatively correlated with forest cover at 2250 meters from the wetland edge, while sediment phosphorous levels were negatively correlated with wetland size and forest cover at 4000 meters and positively correlated with the proportion of land within 4000 meters that is itself wetland. These results suggest that the effects of adjacent land-use on wetland sediment and water quality can extend over comparatively large distances. As such, effective wetland conservation will not be achieved merely through the creation of narrow buffer zones between wetlands and more intensive land-uses. Rather, sustaining high wetland water quality will require maintaining a heterogeneous regional landscape containing relatively large areas of natural forest and wetlands.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016. The key question of precision medicine is whether it is possible to find clinically actionable granularity in diagnosing disease and classifying patient risk. The advent of next-generation sequencing and the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) have provided clinicians and researchers a wealth of data and made possible the precise characterization of individual patient genotypes and phenotypes. Unstructured text—found in biomedical publications and clinical notes—is an important component of genotype and phenotype knowledge. Publications in the biomedical literature provide essential information for interpreting genetic data. Likewise, clinical notes contain the richest source of phenotype information in EHRs. Text mining can render these texts computationally accessible and support information extraction and hypothesis generation. This chapter reviews the mechanics of text mining in precision medicine and discusses several specific use cases, including database curation for personalized cancer medicine, patient outcome prediction from EHR-derived cohorts, and pharmacogenomic research. Taken as a whole, these use cases demonstrate how text mining enables effective utilization of existing knowledge sources and thus promotes increased value for patients and healthcare systems. Text mining is an indispensable tool for translating genotype-phenotype data into effective clinical care that will undoubtedly play an important role in the eventual realization of precision medicine.},

abstract = {Long-term economic scenarios (up to 2100) are needed as a basis to explore possible different futures for major environmental challenges, including climate change. Given the high level of uncertainty involved, such scenarios would need to span a wide range of possible growth trajectories. The recently developed storylines of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) provide a basis for making such projections. This paper describes a consistent methodology to derive (per capita) GDP trend pathways on a country basis. The methodology is based on a convergence process and places emphasis on the key drivers of economic growth in the long run: population, total factor productivity, physical capital, employment and human capital, and energy and fossil fuel resources (specifically oil and gas). The paper uses this methodology to derive country-level economic growth projections for 184 countries. The paper also investigates the influence of short-term growth rate estimates on the long-term income levels in various countries. It does so by comparing long-term projections based on short-term forecasts from 2011 with the projections based on forecasts from 2013. This highlights the effects of the recent economic crisis and uncertainty in short term developments on longer term growth trends. The projections are subject to large uncertainties, particularly for the later decades, and disregard a wide range of country-specific drivers of economic growth that are outside the narrow economic framework, such as external shocks, governance barriers and feedbacks from environmental damage. Hence, they should be interpreted with sufficient care and not be treated as predictions.},

However, by merely looking at the numbers in this age group the problems that have developed among young adults in sub-Saharan Africa, it is imperative that the needs of adolescents be addressed. Adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa constitute 23 percent of the total population; in Zimbabwe 20 of the percent of the population are adolescents. Moreover, since Zimbabwe has a youthful population (45 percent of the population is below 15 years of age) the number of adolescents will increase further in the future.  Adolescence in the process through which an individual makes the transition from childhood to adulthood (Senderowitz and Paxman, 1985). The beginning of this process is related to the onset of puberty and a period when many life-long behaviors are adopted. Traditionally, systems existed in Zimbabwe that prepared adolescents for adult life. Young adults received guidance mainly from their aunts in the case of girls and uncles in the case of boys. But this traditional system has been eroded by socioeconomic development and other "modernizing" influencing. Aunts and uncles are now often physically and socially removed from adolescents and are no longer able to guide them.

Objective and Conceptual Framework: The study analyzed the influence of women?s empowerment on HIV testing. Specifically, indicators of women?s empowerment were linked to women?s socioeconomic characteristics and to HIV testing. Women?s characteristics include age, education, wealth, employment, residence and whether the woman had given birth in the five years preceding the survey. Women?s empowerment indicators include participation in household decision-making, attitudes disapproving wife beating and attitudes that women can refuse sex if their husbands have a sexually transmitted infection.  Methods: The study involved 6,406 women age 15-49 and currently married and living together with their husbands. Descriptive analysis was used to determine the women?s socioeconomic characteristics. Bivariate and multivariate (logistic regression) analyses were used to determine the association between socioeconomic characteristics and women?s empowerment in influencing HIV testing.  Results: Out of the 6,406 women, 4,246 had been tested for HIV. The odds of being tested were higher among women who participated in household decision-making, had disapproving attitudes toward wife beating, and approving attitudes toward refusal of sex. Both for women without a recent birth and for women who gave birth in the past five years and who used ANC services, empowerment is associated with higher likelihood of HIV testing.},

A demonstrable pattern of later age at marriage has emerged from analyses of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from 59 countries in surveys conducted between 1990 and 2002. The delay of marriage is now evident in many but not all countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The trend is mo re advanced in Asia and North Africa; and it is continuing in Latin America, although only modestly. It is occurring in both urban and rural areas and among women with no formal education as well as educated women. In many developing countries, it is reflected by later age at birth for women having their first child. Although teenage fertility is declining in some countries, a few Latin American countries have experienced increases in teenage pregnancy and childbearing, evidently caused by increases in the proportion of sexually active adolescents. These exceptions notwithstanding,the general picture is one of changes consistent with lower fertility and associated improvements in women?s status. Other analyses confirm the decline of polygyny in sub-Saharan Africa, although its prevalence remains high in some countries. Informal unions are increasing. The trend toward later age at marriage for women in sub-Saharan Africa is not evident for men. One result of this difference is the narrowing of the age difference between spouses.},

abstract = {Because employment plays a central role in shaping gender identities and gender relations, it has important implications for understanding women's risks of spousal violence. This article analyzes the relationship between participation in the labor force and the risk of spousal violence against women by treating employment as a symbolic, rather than simply socioeconomic resource. We begin with a latent class analysis that identifies qualitatively distinct patterns of violence against wives. We then examine direct and conditional effects of employment on women's risks of spousal violence. Our results show that the effect of a woman's employment on her risk of spousal violence is conditioned by the employment status of her partner. To some extent, these effects reflect efforts by men to coercively control their female partners.},

abstract = {Catch-up growth is characterized by height velocity above the limits of normal for age for at least 1 year after a transient period of growth inhibition; it can be complete or incomplete. Although catch-up growth can be expressed in terms of height velocity, the change in height standard deviation score is more appropriate. Catch-up growth is difficult to distinguish from the pubertal growth spurt. The increased growth rate following intrauterine growth retardation is usually called catch-up growth, although it does not meet all the criteria. It is not possible to know whether catch-up growth is complete for an individual child, but if final height is within the target range, it can be considered that catch-up growth has probably been complete. In groups of patients, complete catch-up growth is expected to result in a mean final height close to the mean target height. Increased growth velocity due to growth hormone (GH) therapy is accurately called catch-up growth in children with GH deficiency but should be called growth enhancement in children with other disorders. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism of catch-up growth: the neuroendocrine hypothesis, for which no persuasive experimental data have been produced, and the growth plate hypothesis, which cannot explain the increased growth rate observed in human catch-up growth.},

abstract = {Hunger afflicts hundreds of millions of people around the world. However, the very concept of hunger is difficult to define, and in fact the whole issue of hunger has been subsumed under the more comprehensive concept of food security.  This paper retraces the history of this concept, from its original appearance in international usage at the 1974 World Food Conference, to more modern versions like the definition adopted in the First and subsequent World Food Summits. Originally framed in terms of sufficient world supply of food, the concept of food security initially morphed into the aim of national self-sufficiency in the production of food, but later evolved into its current meaning centred on access to food by individuals and households. Under its more recent incarna­tion, and quite unlike its former meaning, it is recognised that international food trade is a key element for achieving food security. This and other conceptual transformations are revised through this paper.},

abstract = {Food insecurity is a daily reality for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Although its most extreme manifestations are often obvious, many other households facing constraints in their access to food are less identifiable. Operational agencies lack a method for differentiating households at varying degrees of food insecurity in order to target and evaluate their interventions. This chapter provides an overview of a set of papers associated with a research initiative that seeks to identify more precise, yet simple, measures of household food insecurity. The overview highlights three main conceptual developments associated with practical approaches to measuring constraints in access to food: 1) a shift from using measures of food availability and utilization to measuring "inadequate access"; 2) a shift from a focus on objective to subjective measures; and 3) a growing emphasis on fundamental measurement as opposed to reliance on distal, proxy measures. Further research is needed regarding 1) how well measures of household food insecurity designed for chronically food-insecure contexts capture the processes leading to, and experience of, acute food insecurity, 2) the impact of short-term shocks, such as major floods or earthquake, on household behaviors that determine responses to food security questions, 3) better measurement of the interaction between severity and frequency of household food insecurity behaviors, and 4) the determination of whether an individual's response to survey questions can be representative of the food insecurity experiences of all members of the household.},

abstract = {In recent years, the ecosystem services (ES) concept has become a major paradigm for natural resource management. While policy-makers demand “hard” monetary evidence that nature conservation would be worth investing in, ongoing attempts are being made to formalize the concept as a scientifically robust “one size fits all” analytical framework. These attempts have highlighted several major limitations of the ES concept. First, to date, the concept has paid little attention to the role of humans in the production of ES. Second, the ongoing formalization of the ES concept is turning it into a “technology of globalization,” thereby increasingly ignoring the socio-cultural context and history within which ecosystems emerge. Third, economic valuation has been shown to limit local stakeholders in expressing their daily and immediate ways of interacting with their environment over and beyond extrinsic motivation provided by financial gains. We address these three limitations by analyzing a social evaluation of the roles of peri-urban farmland from a territorial perspective. Our case study is the Thau lagoon in southern France. We conducted in-depth interviews with a broad range of stakeholders and ran two participatory workshops. Using a territorial meta-model that distinguishes three levels— physical, logical, and existential—stakeholder data were analyzed to unravel the interplay of territorial elements at these three levels that gives rise to ES in two broad categories: food production and aesthetic landscape. The coupling of ES and territory concepts opens up several novel analytical perspectives. It allows partitioning of ES in a manner that “re-contextualizes” them and gives insight about both their physical constituents and their meaning at the territorial level. Additional research should incorporate the dynamics of service demand and supply, and further investigate options for implementation.},

Indonesia has experienced two contradictory population policies. From the time of independence in 1945 until the mid-1960s, the government was strongly pro-natalist, stressing that a large national population was needed to fully exploit the potential of the natural resources of the country. This situation changed as the New Order Government came to power, particularly after President Suharto joined other heads of state in signing the Declaration of the World Leaders in 1967. In this declaration, rapid population growth was considered an obstacle to socioeconomic development. A total policy reversal was signaled when the president established a government agency, called the National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN) which is responsible for coordinating family planning programs in the country. The twin goals of the programs were to promote the norm of a "small, happy, and prosperous family," and to reduce fertility through the promotion of contraceptive use. The quantitative aim of the government population policy has been to achieve replacement level fertility, by vigorously promoting the two-child norm, by the year 2010-2015, and to reach zero population growth by the year 2050.},

abstract = {The economic and man-made resources that sustain human wellbeing are not distributed evenly across the world, but are instead heavily concentrated in cities. Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of ‘leaving no one behind' established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago, predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9{\%} of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7{\%} of individuals in high-income settings. By further triangulating this map against socioeconomic datasets, we demonstrate how access to urban centres stratifies the economic, educational, and health status of humanity.},

abstract = {Swidden agriculture, once the dominant form of land use throughout the uplands and much of the lowlands of Southeast Asia, is being replaced by other land uses. While change and adaptation are inherent to swiddening, the current rapid and widespread transitions are unprecedented. In this paper we review some recent findings on changes in biodiversity, especially plant diversity at various scales, as swidden farming is replaced by other land uses. We focus particularly on two areas of Southeast Asia: northern Thailand and West Kalimantan. We examine actual and potential changes in the diversity of crops that characterize regional swidden systems, as well as that of the spontaneously occurring plants that appear in swidden fields and fallows. Severe declines in plant diversity have been observed in most areas and at most spatial scales when swidden is replaced by permanent land use systems. However, shifts away from swidden agriculture do not invariably result in drastic declines or losses of biological diversity, but may maintain or even enhance it, particularly at finer spatial scales. We suggest that further research is necessary to understand the effects of swidden transitions on biodiversity.},

These services include the preservation of traditional farming knowledge, local crop and animal varieties, and native forms of sociocultural organization. By studying these systems, ecologists can enhance their knowledge of the dynamics of complex systems, especially the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function and practical principles for the design of more sustainable agroecosystems appropriate to small farmers.

abstract = {Systematic reviews are an increasingly popular decision-making tool which provides an unbiased summary of evidence to support conservation action. These reviews bridge the gap between researchers and managers by presenting a comprehensive overview of all studies relating to a particular topic and identify specifically where and under which conditions an effect is present. However, several technical challenges can severely hinder the feasibility and applicability of systematic reviews. One such challenge is the presence of homonyms – terms that share spelling but differ in meaning. Homonyms add a lot of noise to search results but they cannot be easily identified and removed. In this work, we developed a semi-automated approach that can aid in the classification of homonyms between narratives. We used a combination of automated content analysis and artificial neural networks to quickly and accurately sift through large corpora of academic texts and classify them to distinct topics. As an example, we explored the use of the word ‘reintroduction' in academic texts. Reintroduction is used within the conservation context to indicate the release of organisms to their former native habitat, however a ‘Web of Science' search using this word returned thousands of publications that use this term with other meanings and contexts. Using our method, we were able to automatically classify a sample of 3000 of these publications with more than 99{\%} accuracy, when compared to a manual classification. Our approach can be easily used with any other homonym terms and greatly facilitate systematic reviews, or any similar cases where homonyms hinder the harnessing of large text corpora. Beyond homonyms we see great promise in the combination of automated content analysis and machine learning methods in handling and screening big data for relevant information in conservation science.},

abstract = {The population extinction pulse we describe here shows, from a quantitative viewpoint, that Earth's sixth mass extinction is more severe than perceived when looking exclusively at species extinc-tions. Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic popula-tion extirpation and decimation immediately. That conclusion is based on analyses of the numbers and degrees of range contraction (indicative of population shrinkage and/or population extinctions according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature) using a sample of 27,600 vertebrate species, and on a more detailed analysis documenting the population extinctions between 1900 and 2015 in 177 mammal species. We find that the rate of population loss in terrestrial vertebrates is extremely high—even in " species of low concern. " In our sample, comprising nearly half of known vertebrate species, 32{\%} (8,851/27,600) are decreasing; that is, they have de-creased in population size and range. In the 177 mammals for which we have detailed data, all have lost 30{\%} or more of their geographic ranges and more than 40{\%} of the species have experienced severe population declines ({\textgreater}80{\%} range shrinkage). Our data indicate that beyond global species extinctions Earth is experiencing a huge epi-sode of population declines and extirpations, which will have nega-tive cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization. We describe this as a " biological an-nihilation " to highlight the current magnitude of Earth's ongoing sixth major extinction event. sixth mass extinction | population declines | population extinctions | conservation | ecosystem service},

abstract = {Comments on an article Catch-up growth following illness or starvation. An example of developmental canalization in man by A. Prader et al. (1966). In 1963, Prader et al. and Tanner introduced the term "catch-up growth" to describe this period of rapid linear growth in children that followed a period of growth inhibition, leading toward their original growth channel. The term catch-up growth is also used for the growth acceleration seen in 85{\%} of infants born small for gestational age (SGA), although in these cases there is usually no information about the foregoing downward deviation. The term catch-up growth is mostly used for height. Catch-up growth has been defined as "a height velocity above the statistical limits of normality for age or maturity during a defined period of time, following a transient period of growth inhibition; the effect of catch-up growth is to take the child towards his/her pre-retardation growth curve." The multiphase approach would imply that there is not one single marker of catch-up but rather a pattern composed of several elements. After the cessation or appropriate treatment of a postnatal insult or illness leading to slow growth, catch-up growth is expected. Besides the classic type A catch-up growth and the slower type B, we suggest the existence of an intermediate-type AB characterized by an initial period of fast growth followed by a stable height SDS below TH SDS.

abstract = {The consolidation of the scientific publishing industry has been the topic of much debate within and outside the scientific community, especially in relation to major publishers' high profit margins. However, the share of scientific output published in the journals of these major publishers, as well as its evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical sciences (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor {\&} Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for more than 50{\%} of all papers published in 2013. Disciplines of the social sciences have the highest level of concentration (70{\%} of papers from the top five publishers), while the humanities have remained relatively independent (20{\%} from top five publishers). NMS disciplines are in between, mainly because of the strength of their scientific societies, such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The paper also examines the migration of journals between small and big publishing houses and explores the effect of publisher change on citation impact. It concludes with a discussion on the economics of scholarly publishing. Papers},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new composite index to measure the multidimensional concept of food security. Although other indicators with the same objective exist, they come with several methodological shortfalls. The Proteus index makes a twofold contribution: a) we apply all the steps needed to tackle the uncertainty sources inherent to building a composite indicator (variable selection, data imputation, normalization, weighting and aggregation) and test the assumptions through a Monte Carlo procedure that applies a variance-based sensitivity analysis of model output; and b) the results are robust over time and are comparable within and between countries, thus allowing a measure that can track the country progress towards food security. We demonstrate that the main sources of output variability are weighting, normalization, data imputation, variable selection, and aggregation in descending order of importance, but interaction effects between the uncertainty sources also play a key role. The index provides a contribution to food security monitoring. While it identifies countries requiring priority attention for their chronic situation, it proves flexible enough to capture sudden onset crises. It also reflects the main drivers that can dramatically affect a country's food security in the short run, insofar suggesting potential areas of intervention for policy makers.},

abstract = {This study examines the adoption of contraceptive use after a birth, using reproductive calendar data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in Kenya, Indonesia, the Dominican Republic, and Peru for women age 15-49. Socioeconomic and demographic differentials of the probability of using contraception at 2, 6, 9, and 12 months after a birth are investigated using multiple decrement life table. The Cox multivariate proportional hazards model is used to examine predictors of the duration between childbirth and first use of contraception in the first 12 months after a birth. Results from bivariate analyses show that in all four countries the likelihood of adopting contraception in the first 12 months after a birth increases with the level of education of the mother, her exposure to the media, the wealth status of the household, and whether delivery was at a public or private health facility.  The findings also indicate that between 20 percent and 40 percent of women in the countries studied did not initiate contraceptive use postpartum before they became at risk for another pregnancy. Multivariate analyses suggest that in all four countries education and wealth status have a significant positive association with the adoption of any contraceptive method during the first 12 months postpartum. Also, in three of the countries mother?s exposure to mass media has a significant positive association with adoption of a contraceptive method. In addition, mothers from wealthier households, with formal education, and age 25 and older are more likely to initiate use of non-hormonal and hormonal contraceptive methods in the first 12 months after a birth. },

abstract = {Traditional ecological knowledge and local experience of resource management and the usefulness of plant species can make important contributions to attempts to understand forest ecosystems and to develop effective sustainable management strategies for them. Therefore, the utilization of tree species by local people, their perceptions of changes in the surrounding forests, and suggested solutions for associated problems, were studied in the Sissili province of southern Burkina Faso. Information was collected through a combination of participatory rural appraisals, household interviews, and observational methods. Principal component analysis was used to analyze the consumptive values of woody species and their respective parts. A total of 82 species were identified, 90{\%} of them were used for medicinal purposes, 78{\%} for fodder, 73{\%} for food, 67{\%} for house construction, and 58{\%} for wood carving. This suggests that forests play a key role in sustaining the rural livelihood and contributing to poverty reduction. The various stakeholders perceived that vegetation clearing for cultivation of cash crops (agribusiness) was the main driver of the change in forest cover. Species reported to be declining in the area included Parkia biglobosa, Pterocarpus erinaceus, Afzelia africana, Bombax costatum,Tamarindus indica, and Diospyros mespiliformis. Thus, a concerted effort should be made to manage the remaining natural forests in the country. Appropriate management strategies should be developed jointly by the local communities and external support groups to integrate the valuable local knowledge about forest species with the stakeholders' suggestions in order to promote sustainable management of the region's forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {Hunger and malnutrition are devastating problems, particularly for the poor and unprivileged. According to the study by the Ethiopian Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation, 50 percent of the Ethiopian population are living below the food poverty line and cannot meet their daily minimum nutritional requirement of 2200 calories. Women in the reproductive age group and children are most vulnerable to malnutrition due to low dietary intakes, inequitable distribution of food within the household, improper food storage and preparation, dietary taboos, infectious diseases, and care.  The prevalence of stunting in children below five years in East Africa averages about 48 percent, which is the highest in the world. Evidence also showed that the situation in Ethiopia is worse than in other East African countries. A few local studies on child nutrition have also shown similar results and confirmed that malnutrition, i.e., stunting, is one of the most important public health problems in this country. The present study is based on national data from the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) with reference to the 13,447 women age 15-49 years and 9,768 children under five. The general objective of this study is to examine the impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on maternal and child nutritional status, using multivariate analysis. This study also examines the association of exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding with stunting among children under age five.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. Agricultural development efforts that do not address persistent gender gaps miss opportunities for greater impact. This synthesis reflects on key findings from integrated quantitative and qualitative analyses at the nexus of gender, agricultural development, and climate change. Linked farm household-, intrahousehold-, community-, and institutional-level data highlight significant and nuanced gender differences in adaptive capacity of individuals and communities to respond to climate change. The gender gap is also substantial in exposure to climate change and its impacts, and uptake of new practices that lower vulnerability. Women in agriculture will remain largely neglected by information and service providers unless their differing needs, access to, and control over resources are considered at policy and project design stage. Yet clear guidelines for addressing the needs of both men and women in different environments and agricultural systems are still lacking. Participatory ‘action research' approaches with a focus on co-learning, and using innovative cell phone or social media-based approaches offer exciting new opportunities. Agricultural development decision-makers and project designers need to ‘design with gender in mind'. Equipping them with tools and knowledge of innovative gender-transformative practices and intervention options and creating accountability for serving women and men will be key.},

abstract = {The gastrointestinal hormone peptide tyrosine tyrosine 3-36 (PYY3-36) has attained broad recognition with respect to its involvement in energy homeostasis and the control of food intake. It is mainly secreted by distal intestinal enteroendocrine L-cells in response to eating and exerts both neurally mediated paracrine and endocrine effects on various target organs. In addition to its gastrointestinal effects, PYY3-36 has long been known to inhibit food intake. Recent closer examination of the effects of PYY3-36 revealed that this gut-derived peptide also influences a wide spectrum of behavioral and cognitive functions that are pivotal for basic processes of perception and judgment, including central information processing, salience learning, working memory, and behavioral responding to novelty. Here, we review the effects of PYY3-36 that go beyond food intake and provide a conceptual framework suggesting that several apparently unrelated behavioral actions of PYY3-36 may actually reflect different manifestations of modulating the central dopamine system.},

An analysis of climate risks for crops in 12 food-insecure regions was conducted to identify adaptation priorities, based on statistical crop models and climate projections for 2030 from 20 general circulation models. Results indicate South Asia and Southern Africa as two regions that, without sufficient adaptation measures, will likely suffer negative impacts on several crops that are important to large food-insecure human populations. We also find that uncertainties vary widely by crop, and therefore priorities will depend on the risk attitudes of investment institutions.},

abstract = {First generation biofuels provide a number of ecosystem services (e.g., fuel, climate regulation) but they also compromise other ecosystem services (e.g., food, freshwater services) which are of paramount value to human wellbeing. However, this knowledge is fragmented and little is known about how the ecosystem services provided and/or compromised by biofuels link to human wellbeing. In fact, whether biofuels production and use can have a negative or positive impact on the environment and society depends on several interconnected factors. This paper provides a critical review of the drivers, impacts and tradeoffs of biofuel production and use. In particular, it rationalizes the evidence coming from diverse academic disciplines and puts it into perspective by employing the ecosystem services framework popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). An outcome of this systematic review is a simplified conceptual framework that illustrates the main trade-offs of biofuel production and use by employing a consistent language grounded on the concepts of ecosystem services. Given the almost complete lack of literature explicitly linking biofuels and ecosystem services, our review concludes by identifying priority research areas on the interface of biofuels, ecosystem services and human wellbeing. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forests and tree-based systems are an important component of rural landscapes, sustaining livelihoods and contributing to the food security and nutritional needs of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Historically, these systems developed under a wide variety of ecological conditions, and cultural and socio-economic contexts, as integrated approaches that combined management of forest and agricultural areas to provide primarily for the needs of producers and their local communities. Today they serve food and nutrition demands of growing global populations, both urban and rural. Population increase, globalisation, deforestation, land degradation, and ever-increasing demand and associated conflict for land (including forest) resources are placing pressure on these lands. Farmers have been encouraged to intensify food production on existing agricultural lands, by modifying some traditional practices (such as agroforestry) or abandoning others (such as shifting cultivation) that evolved over centuries to cope with biophysical constraints (e.g. limited soil fertility, climate variability) and changing socio-economic conditions. This chapter provides an overview of forests and tree-based systems and their role in enhancing food security and nutrition for rural communities and those served through the marketplace. The variability and viability of these management systems are considered within and across geographical regions and agro-ecological zones. Also discussed is the role of the social, cultural and economic contexts in which these systems exist, with a focus on three factors that affect the socioeconomic organisation of forests and tree-based systems, namely: land and tree tenure and governance, human capital (including knowledge and labour) and financial capital (including credit). How these biophysical and socio-economic conditions and their complex interactions influence food security and nutrition outcomes, particularly for vulnerable segments of the population (i.e., the poor, women and children), are of particular concern.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Linear growth retardation (stunting) is associated with lower adult cognition, educational attainment, and income. These effects, together with possible effects of stunting on birth weight and subsequent growth of offspring, suggest that stunting could be associated with poor development in the next generation of children. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare developmental levels in children born to parents who were stunted or nonstunted in early childhood. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of the children of participants in the Jamaica supplementation and stimulation study. The analysis compared children born to a parent who was stunted at age 9-24 mo, and did not receive the stimulation intervention, with children born to a parent in the nonstunted group. Developmental levels were measured with the Griffiths mental development scales between ages 12 and 72 mo. Mixed model regression analyses were conducted to allow for clustering of children within families and child (repeat assessments). The analyses included 89 children with a total of 156 assessments. Caregiver and home characteristics associated with the developmental quotient (DQ) or any of the subscales were included in the regressions. RESULTS: Children born to a stunted parent had lower DQs (-5.29 points; 95{\%} CI: -9.06, -1.52 points; P = 0.01) and lower scores on the cognitive subscale (-5.77 points; 95{\%} CI: -10.68, -0.87 points; P = 0.022). The offspring of stunted parents had lower height-for-age (-0.61 z scores; 95{\%} CI: -1.13, -0.10 z scores; P = 0.021). In analyses, adjusting for child height-for-age or birth weight, the developmental differences remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report comparing the development of offspring of persons stunted in early childhood to the development of offspring of nonstunted parents. The findings suggest that the impact of stunting on development continues in the next generation of children. If replicated, these findings have important implications for estimation of the cost of stunting to social and economic development.},

Our reviewed studies cover a broad range of intervention models, and many forms of violence - ie, intimate partner violence, non-partner sexual assault, female genital mutilation, and child marriage. Evidence is highly skewed towards that from studies from high-income countries, with these evaluations mainly focusing on responses to violence. This evidence suggests that women-centred, advocacy, and home-visitation programmes can reduce a woman's risk of further victimisation, with less conclusive evidence for the preventive effect of programmes for perpetrators. In low-income and middle-income countries, there is a greater research focus on violence prevention, with promising evidence on the effect of group training for women and men, community mobilisation interventions, and combined livelihood and training interventions for women. Despite shortcomings in the evidence base, several studies show large effects in programmatic timeframes. Across different forms of violence, effective programmes are commonly participatory, engage multiple stakeholders, support critical discussion about gender relationships and the acceptability of violence, and support greater communication and shared decision making among family members, as well as non-violent behaviour. Further investment in intervention design and assessment is needed to address evidence gaps.},

abstract = {Common agricultural practice in West Africa involves alternating crop cultivation for 10-12 years and thereafter leaving the field to rest (fallow) for 10-15 years. With increasing population pressure and growing demand for food on the one hand, and the lack of unexploited lands on the other, soils undergo fast degradation. In an attempt to predict soil degradation, 12 fields were sampled around Kita, Mali. Seven of these fields were under cultivation whereas the remaining fields were fallow or virgin soils. The soil pH, electrical conductivity, N-NO3, N-NH4, P, K, and the soil organic matter (SOM) were determined. Of all variables, only nitrogen and SOM showed significant linear relationship with cotton lint at the cultivated fields, with SOM being the only variable showing a clear threshold (of 18 t/ha) that distinguishes between fertile and infertile fields. Based on field observations a simple model of the family agricultural land use is presented, aiming to provide a link between agriculture practice and soil degradation. The model demonstrates that the current practices of cultivation and fertilization will result in a slow but inevitable decrease of SOM, with SOM reaching, in 25-35 years, a critical level, below which cotton growth will no longer be economical. We thus conclude that the current practice of cultivation is inefficient and a new cultivation practice, which accounts for the cardinal role of SOM should be adopted. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The report also discusses how the specific questions on FGC used in DHS surveys have changed over time (1989 to 2002). There has been variation in how women are asked about their circumcision status and, if circumcised, what type of circumcision was performed. There has also been variation in the way daughters are identified for purposes of determining circumcision status, and variation in the questions on individual perceptions about FGC. },

abstract = {The aims of this study were to determine the sociodemographic and dietary correlates of household and child food insecurity in Bogot{\'{a}}, Colombia and to examine whether food insecurity is a risk factor for underweight or overweight in this population. We analyzed data from 2359 families with 2526 children 5-12 y of age who completed a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2006. The survey was representative of low- and middle-income families who had children enrolled in the public primary school system of Bogot{\'{a}}. We used a 16-item food insecurity scale, modified from the United States Household Food Security Survey Module, assessed children's dietary intake with a FFQ, and measured their height and weight. Mothers' anthropometry was obtained through self-report. We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios and 95{\%} CI from binomial regression models. Household food insecurity with hunger and child food insecurity were each positively associated with maternal age, parity, and single parent status and inversely related to mean household income and number of home assets. Animal protein and snack food intake were inversely related to child food insecurity. In multivariate analyses, food-insecure children were 3 times more likely to be underweight than food-secure children (95{\%} CI = 1.6, 5.4; P = 0.0007). Hunger in the household was significantly associated with maternal underweight. Food insecurity was not related to child stunting, child overweight, or maternal overweight. The prevalence of food insecurity in Bogot{\'{a}} is high and related to poverty. Food insecurity does not necessarily predict overweight in countries undergoing the nutrition transition.},

Using a survey of 546 farming households and employing multinomial logit regression, this study investigates rice farmers' adaptation to water scarcity in a semi-arid climate in Bangladesh. It identified factors determining farmers' adaptation responses to addressing water scarcity. The analysis shows that farmers with more experience of farming, better schooling, more secure tenure rights, better access to electricity and institutional facilities and an awareness of climatic effects are more likely to adopt alternative adaptation strategies. Farmers' alternative adaptation choices are examined in comparison to the traditional approach of groundwater irrigation. This study raises issues of sustainability of agricultural adaptation practices in the context of an increasing dependence on groundwater irrigation. The results provide an insight to sustainable irrigation practices and an understanding of the characteristics of farms and farming households to frame better strategies to cope with water-stressed regimes in drought-prone environments.},

abstract = {After a series of studies that revealed the protective effect of male circumcision against HIV infection, WHO/UNAIDS in 2007 recommended the adoption of safe male circumcision as one of the effective strategies in reducing heterosexually acquired HIV. To this effect, in 2010 the Ministry of Health in Uganda developed a circumcision policy, and circumcision was added to the strategy of abstinence, being faithful, and condom use (ABC) to protect against AIDS. Especially after the implementation of the safe  male circumcision (SMC) policy, however, there has been a concern that some circumcised men may lead a more risky sexual lifestyle than non- circumcised men. This paper, therefore, examines the associations am ong circumcision status, age at circumcision, risky sexual behavi ors, and HIV serostatus among men.  The paper uses data from the 2011 Uganda AIDS Indicator Survey, focusing on a subsample of 7,969 weighted cases of men age 15-59 who have ever had sex and who have received their HIV test results. The paper examines associations between risky sexual behaviors and circumcision status among all men, and associations between risky sexual behaviors and age at circumcision among circumcised men. At the multivariate level, the paper establishes the independent relationships between circumcision status and age at circumcision, risky sexual behaviors, and HIV serostatus.  Results show that 28{\%} of men in Uganda have been circumcised, and the majority were circumcised before age 10. At the bivariate level, circumcision status is not independent of risky sexual behaviors. Results from the logistic regression models show that circumcised men are more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors, while age at circumcision is not significantly associated with these behaviors. Circumcised men are also less likely to be HIV-positive.  The findings suggest a need to repackage the circumcision messages to account for the increased risky sexual behaviors among men who have been circumcised. Intensified, individual tailored counseling before and af ter SMC procedures may help to reduce these risky behaviors. Furthermore, qualitative research should explore the reasons for circumcision and the drivers for risky sexual behavior.},

To best manage these resources, it is critical to first understand the ecological processes influencing the behaviour of plants in their habitats. Previous work on the spatial patterns of trees has failed to account for the effects of plot size. Here, we determined the optimal plot size required to analyse and accurately represent the spatial patterns of trees. Five plot sizes (0.25-1.5 ha) from a representative stand of 2.25 ha were compared on the basis of simulations. We estimated the lengths of clumped radii and the strengths of the relationships between Isoberlinia spp. and subsidiary species using Ripley's K(r) function. The lengths of clumped radii (1.5-6 m) differed significantly with and were proportional to plot size. The spatial relationships between Isoberlinia spp. and subsidiary species were random, irrespective of plot size, but with a tendency towards repulsion. The spatial patterns of 1.0- and 1.5-ha plots were statistically similar to those of the main stand. Given the investigation costs, a plot size of 1.0 ha may be reasonably considered as suitable for behavioural studies of tree species in Sudanian ecosystems.},

abstract = {Food systems contribute 19{\%}–29{\%} of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, releasing 9,800–16,900 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCOe) in 2008. Agricultural production, including indirect emissions associated with land-cover change, contributes 80{\%}–86{\%} of total food system emissions, with significant regional variation. The impacts of global climate change on food systems are expected to be widespread, complex, geographically and temporally variable, and profoundly influenced by socioeconomic conditions. Historical statistical studies and integrated assessment models provide evidence that climate change will affect agricultural yields and earnings, food prices, reliability of delivery, food quality, and, notably, food safety. Low-income producers and consumers of food will be more vulnerable to climate change owing to their comparatively limited ability to invest in adaptive institutions and technologies under increasing climatic risks. Some synergies among food security, adaptation, and mitigation are feasible. But promising interventions, such as agricultural intensification or reductions in waste, will require careful management to distribute costs and benefits effectively.},

abstract = {West African countries experience mortality two to three times higher than countries in northern Africa and much of southern Africa. The countries also show differential trends in levels and age patterns of childhood mortality. While it appears that some countries have experienced significant declines in recent mortality, others appear to have experienced a reversal. Because of the complexities associated with analyzing trends from cross-sectional data, this report will focus on the major determinants of mortality in the ten years preceding the period 1997?2001. Its contribution is a consideration of a broad class of spatial covariates. Several individual and household-level factors have been identified as key determinants of infant and child survival, such as maternal education and the pace of childbearing. Many studies indicate that environmental or geographic factors also play an important role, including population density, climate, disease environment, and urban residence. However, few studies have been able to incorporate environmental factors that are explicitly spatial. Spatial variables include distances from households or communities, and environmental characteristics that have their own geographic boundaries. This study makes further inroads by incorporating several new or previously hard-to-integrate sources of spatial data. The primary objective of this report is to explore and draw attention to the effects of a largely unexplored body of environmental information on infant and child mortality. The  underlying motivation is to account for some portion of the variance that has not been explained by the traditional socioeconomic and biodemographic determinants of childhood mortality.},

We use data from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women to examine the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, and relationships between suicide attempts and mental health status, child sexual abuse, partner violence and other variables. Population representative cross-sectional household surveys were conducted from 2000-2003 in 13 provincial (more rural) and city (urban) sites in Brazil, Ethiopia, Japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia, Thailand and Tanzania. 20967 women aged 15-49 years participated. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts, lifetime suicidal thoughts, and suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine factors associated with suicide attempts in each site. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts ranged from 0.8{\%} (Tanzania) to 12.0{\%} (Peru city); lifetime thoughts of suicide from 7.2{\%} (Tanzania province) to 29.0{\%} (Peru province), and thoughts in the past four weeks from 1.9{\%} (Serbia) to 13.6{\%} (Peru province). 25-50{\%} of women with suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks had also visited a health worker in that time. The most consistent risk factors for suicide attempts after adjusting for probable common mental health disorders were: intimate partner violence, non-partner physical violence, ever being divorced, separated or widowed, childhood sexual abuse and having a mother who had experienced intimate partner violence. Mental health policies and services must recognise the consistent relationship between violence and suicidality in women in low and middle income countries. Training health sector workers to recognize and respond to the consequences of violence may substantially reduce the health burden associated with suicidal behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The evolution of online social networks offers new possibilities for collecting data about public interest. Building on an analysis of text messages on Twitter, this study aimed to quantify the level of public attention toward different mammal and bird species listed (at the full species or subspecies/population level) under the United States' Endangered Species Act (ESA). Once a month during 1 year, I searched recently posted messages (‘tweets') for the common names of every listed spe- cies. The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) was by far the most tweeted species. The other most tweeted mammals were the American bison (Bison bison), brown bear (U. arctos), cougar (Puma concolor), killer whale (Orcinus orca), black bear (U. americanus) and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), respectively. The three most frequently tweeted birds were the sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), whooping crane (G. americana) and spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Some species, such as the manatee, right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), and gray wolf (Canis lupus) ranked higher when restricting the search to conservation contexts. The results suggest that Twitter users interact about a biased sample of ESA- listed species: mammals were better represented than birds among the most tweeted spe- cies and larger-sized species received more tweets. The findings can be used for priori- tizing conservation education and marketing campaigns aiming to raise the profile of lesser-known listed species. Data from online social networks open the door for a range of novel applications in conservation science. Communicated},

abstract = {Although given prominence in the context of the current World Trade Organization (WTO) trade negotiations, trade reforms are generally a component of a wider set of economic and institutional reforms. The complexity of reform packages, the wide variation in policy sets, the context within which they are used, and the thoroughness with which they are followed through, makes it extremely difficult to isolate the impact of specific trade reforms on the food security status of developing countries. As yet, there is no clear consensus on answers to general questions, such as “will developing countries benefit from reduced agricultural protection in economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)?”, let alone more specific questions which might include “how can developing country governments best promote smallholder agriculture in the new global environment, and what form of special and differential treatment might be required to allow them to do so?” In many cases, “successful” reforms have been achieved not in isolation, but as a consequence of associated policy implementation. In drawing lessons from reforms that are perceived to have benefited food insecure groups, or at the very least, not to have disadvantaged them, it is therefore important to identify the complementary policies that facilitated the process of adjustment to more productive activities, and any compensatory policies that acted to alleviate the transitional losses that insecure groups may otherwise have faced. A clearer understanding of the often-obscured effects of trade reform on food security is therefore vital if the drivers of further reform are to result in changes to the benefit of insecure and vulnerable groups in poor countries.},

The study explores - household decisions to collect gum arabic in the forest using the two stage Heckman selection model. The data for the analysis come from the 213 randomly sampled collectors from the north-eastern and western regions of Kenya. The findings show that livestock ownership, possession of skills, insecurity and price obtained from the previous season impact on decision making to collect gum arabic. Furthermore, household's age, experience in collecting gum arabic and topography increase the quantities collected while gender negatively impacts amounts of collection. The research concludes by emphasizing that collection of the non-timber forest products including gum arabic would be attractive if the returns from collection justify the risk and cost to go to the forest. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper examines NTFPs' role in contributing to the household economy and how different socio-economic factors may influence this contribution. Field methods involved quantitative and qualitative data collection of forest-adjacent households of Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. Results show that the contribution of different types of NTFPs to household economy varies in terms of subsistence and cash income. However, overall NTFP income is much higher than income from timber or firewood which indicates a larger dependence of the households on NTFPs. Income data analysis also finds that the poor households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs for their subsistence and cash income than the better-off households. Moreover, the study reveals that there are many other socio-economic factors at the household level such as number of members in household and total value of household implements and furniture that are significantly correlated with the NTFP income. More site-specific applied research on NTFP income and influential factors is necessary to generalize the findings for other parts of the world with similar socio-economic and environmental settings. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Unmet need, a central concept in family planning research and a key indicator for programmatic interventions, is a composite measure based on apparent contradictions between women?s reproductive intentions and non-use of family planning. Demographic and Health Surveys, the largest source of data on contraceptive patterns in developing countries, compute unmet need based on responses to 18 questions asked at different points during the women?s interview. This report describes the results of a mixed-methods follow-up study nested within the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS). Women in 13 clusters who were identified as having unmet need, along with a reference group of women who reported using family planning, were approached to be reinterviewed (RR=92.3{\%}) within an average of three weeks from their GDHS interview. Among fecund women identified by the 2014 GDHS as having unmet need, follow-up interviews revealed substantial underreporting of method use, particularly traditional methods. Complete postpartum abstinence was sometimes the intended method of family planning but was overlooked during questions about method use. Other respondents classified as having unmet need had ambivalent fertility intentions. In several cases, respondents expressed revised fertility intentions upon follow-up that would have made them ineligible for inclusion in the unmet need category. The reference group of family planning users also expressed unstable fertility intentions. Interviews with women who had consistent fertility intentions and perceived themselves at risk of an unintended pregnancy but who were not using family planning revealed multiple reasons for aversion to modern method use, particularly the risk of side effects, personal or partner opposition to family planning, and religious views. The most common side effect women were concerned about was menstrual irregularities. Partners have an important influence on fertility intentions and family planning use. In some cases women?s desire to avoid pregnancy is weaker than their desire to please their husbands. While unmet need is typically used as a proxy for latent demand for family planning, among those studied, potential demand for family planning appears to account for a relatively small proportion of unmet need. The study reveals some data quality concerns, largely in the area of traditional method measurement. In addition to these substantive findings, study results produce lessons learned for nested qualitative studies and for population-based surveys that measure family planning.  },

abstract = {Most of Southern Africa is affected by extreme weather events, droughts and floods being the most common. The frequency of floods and droughts in Southern Africa in general, of which the Zambezi River Basin is part of, has been linked to climate change. Droughts and floods impact on the natural environment, and directly and indirectly impact on livelihoods. In the Middle Zambezi River Basin, which is located between Kariba and Cahora Bassa dams, extreme weather events are exacerbated by human activities, in particular the operation of both the Kariba and the Cahora Bassa reservoirs. To understand better, whether, and in what ways extreme weather events impact on livelihoods, this study used both quantitative and qualitative research methods to analyse rainfall variability and coping strategies used by households in the river basin. Data collection was done using semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and structured questionnaires which were administered to 144 households. An analysis of rainfall variability and Cahora Bassa water level over 23. years was carried out. The study found that perceptions of households were that average rainfall has decreased over the years, and dry-spells have become more frequent. Furthermore, households perceived flood events to have increased over the last two decades. However, the analysis of rainfall variability revealed that the average rainfall received between 1988 and 2011 had not changed but the frequency of dry-spells and floods had increased. The occurrence of floods in the study area was found to be linked to heavy local rain and backflow from Cahora Bassa dam. The study found that households adopted a number of strategies to cope with droughts and floods, such as vegetable farming and crop production in the floodplain, taking on local jobs that brought in wages, planting late and livestock disposals. Some households also resorted to out-migration on a daily basis to Zambia or Mozambique. The study concluded that coping mechanisms were found to be inflexible and poorly suited to adapt to floods and droughts. The study recommends the implementation of adaptation measures such as the cultivation of drought-resistant crop varieties, irrigation and off-farm employment opportunities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The United States produces 41{\%} of the world's corn and 38{\%} of the world's soybeans. These crops comprise two of the four largest sources of caloric energy produced and are thus critical for world food supply. We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29° C for corn, 30° C for soybeans, and 32° C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30-46{\%} before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63-82{\%} under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model.},

abstract = {The context of this article is the surge in large-scale land acquisitions of African lands by local and foreign investors for commercial food, livestock, oil palm and carbon trading purposes. Involuntary loss of rural lands at scale is not new to Africa's majority rural poor, nor is it driven by a single factor. Historically inequitable land relations within communities, compounded by a century of capitalist transformation, take their toll. This study argues, however, that the weak legal status of communal rights is the most pernicious enabler in their demise, allowing governments to take undue liberties with their citizens' lands, and particularly those which are unfarmed and by tradition held in common. While international acquiescence to abusive domestic law helps entrench the diminishment of majority land rights, the domestic laws themselves are principally at fault and necessarily the target for change. This legal vulnerability is explored here through an examination of more than twenty African land laws. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Institute of Social Studies.},

abstract = {Given that smallholder farmers are frequently food insecure and rely significantly on rain-fed agriculture, it is critical to examine climate variability and food insecurity. We utilize data from smallholder farmer surveys from 12 countries with 30 years of rainfall data to examine how rainfall variability and household resources are correlated with food security. We find that on average, households that experienced a drier than average year are 3.81 months food insecure, while households within a normal range of rainfall were 3.67 months food insecure, and wetter than average households were 2.86 months food insecure. Reduced odds of food insecurity is associated with agricultural inputs, ownership of livestock, water use efficiency, financial services, and participation in a group. However, in drier than average households, financial services as compared to agricultural inputs and agroecological practices have a greater prevalence of reduced instances of food insecurity, while agricultural inputs are more common for reduced food insecurity in wetter than average households. Only the use of fertilizer consistently results in reduced odds of food insecurity across all households regardless of rainfall, demonstrating that one-size fits all approaches to food security interventions are likely ineffective, and place-specific interventions considering climatic factors are critically important.},

Comparing quantitative data from two different points in time allows researchers to identify 'livelihood trajectories', or the general direction of either improvement or decline.

In this study a comparison between the two approaches in the assessment of undernutrition has been made at the level of individual countries, utilizing until recently unavailable anthropometric data for adults. Results indicate that the two approaches yield strongly divergent and even contradictory results. In view of the complex methodology and tremendous data needs for estimating prevalence of food energy inadequacy and the relative straightforwardness of anthropometric assessment, it is concluded that anthropometric data are likely to be a more reliable source of information for estimating prevalence rates of undernutrition.

abstract = {Diarrheal disease (DD) due to contaminated water is a major cause of child mortality globally. Forests and wetlands can provide ecosystem services that help maintain water quality. To understand the connections between land cover and childhood DD, we compiled a database of 293,362 children in 35 countries with information on health, socioeconomic factors, climate, and watershed condition. Using hierarchical models, here we find that higher upstream tree cover is associated with lower probability of DD downstream. This effect is significant for rural households but not for urban households, suggesting differing dependence on watershed conditions. In rural areas, the effect of a 30{\%} increase in upstream tree cover is similar to the effect of improved sanitation, but smaller than the effect of improved water source, wealth or education. We conclude that maintaining natural capital within watersheds can be an important public health investment, especially for populations with low levels of built capital. Globally diarrheal disease through contaminated water sources is a major cause of child mortality. Here, the authors compile a database of 293,362 children in 35 countries and find that upstream tree cover is linked to a lower probability of diarrheal disease and that increasing tree cover may lower mortality.},

abstract = {Growing maize (Zea mays L.) in association with legume trees in agroforestry arrangements has been shown to increase yields in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa; however, the stability of crop yields has not been critically analyzed in the various cropping systems that integrate leguminous trees. T e objective of this analysis was to compare yield stability in improved cropping systems, namely maize–gliricidia [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth] intercropping and fertilized monoculture maize, with the de facto practice of resource-poor farmers who grow maize continuously without any external input. Yield stability was determined for three long-term fi eld trials (12–13 consecutive yr) conducted at Makoka Research Station in southern Malawi and Msekera Research Station in eastern Zambia. At Makoka, the most stable yield was recorded in maize–gliricidia intercrops. Average yield was highest for maize–gliricidia intercropping amended with 50{\%} of the recommended N and P fertilizer, and this was comparable with the yield recorded in monoculture maize that received inorganic fertilizer. On the two sites at Msekera, the highest yield was recorded in fertilized monoculture maize, followed by maize–gliricidia intercrops. Yields were more stable, however, in maize–gliricidia intercropping than fertilized maize on both sites at Msekera. It was concluded that maize yields remain more stable in maize–gliricidia intercropping than in fertilized maize monoculture in the long term, although average yields may be higher with full fertilization.},

abstract = {Models of climate change predict increased variability of weather as well as changes in agro-ecology. The increased variability will pose special challenges for nutrition. This study reviews evidence on climate shocks and nutrition and estimates the economic consequences in terms of reduced schooling and economic productivity stemming from nutritional insults in childhood. Panel data covering up to 20 y indicate that that short-term climate shocks have long-term impacts on children that persist, often into their adult lives. Other studies document the potential for relief programs to offset these shocks providing that the programs can be implemented with flexible financing, rapid identification of those affected by the shock, and timely scale-up. The last of these presumes that programs are already in place with contingency plans drawn up. Arguably, direct food distribution, including that of ready-to-use therapeutic food, may be part of the overall strategy. Even if such programs are too expensive for sustainable widespread use in the prevention of malnutrition, scalable food distribution programs may be cost effective to address the heightened risk of malnutrition following weather-related shocks.},

abstract = {Insufficient data exist for accurate estimation of global nutrient supplies. Commonly used global datasets contain key weaknesses: 1) data with global coverage, such as the FAO food balance sheets, lack specific information about many individual foods and no information on micronutrient supplies nor heterogeneity among subnational populations, while 2) household surveys provide a closer approximation of consumption, but are often not nationally representative, do not commonly capture many foods consumed outside of the home, and only provide adequate information for a few select populations. Here, we attempt to improve upon these datasets by constructing a new model--the Global Expanded Nutrient Supply (GENuS) model--to estimate nutrient availabilities for 23 individual nutrients across 225 food categories for thirty-four age-sex groups in nearly all countries. Furthermore, the model provides historical trends in dietary nutritional supplies at the national level using data from 1961-2011. We determine supplies of edible food by expanding the food balance sheet data using FAO production and trade data to increase food supply estimates from 98 to 221 food groups, and then estimate the proportion of major cereals being processed to flours to increase to 225. Next, we estimate intake among twenty-six demographic groups (ages 20+, both sexes) in each country by using data taken from the Global Dietary Database, which uses nationally representative surveys to relate national averages of food consumption to individual age and sex-groups; for children and adolescents where GDD data does not yet exist, average calorie-adjusted amounts are assumed. Finally, we match food supplies with nutrient densities from regional food composition tables to estimate nutrient supplies, running Monte Carlo simulations to find the range of potential nutrient supplies provided by the diet. To validate our new method, we compare the GENuS estimates of nutrient supplies against independent estimates by the USDA for historical US nutrition and find very good agreement for 21 of 23 nutrients, though sodium and dietary fiber will require further improvement.},

This report is a study of that change based on interview data collected in the Reproductive Health Surveys conducted in 1999 and 2005 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Couples in Georgia are clearly aiming for very small families with a total fertility rate of 1.6 births per woman.  Because their desired family size is reached early in marriage, women are exposed to the risk of unintentional pregnancy over a long period of time.  The latest survey showed that 62 percent of pregnancies were unintended with almost all (96 percent) of these terminated by abortion. Contraceptive use is relatively low in Georgia with only 27{\%} of married women using a modern method, a slight increase from five years earlier. Contraceptive failure rates are particularly high among women using traditional methods, mostly withdrawal. Nonuse of any contraception is the main explanation of the high abortion rate, accounting for nearly two-thirds of all abortions. Several simulations showed the large effect on the reduction of abortion by increases in the use of modern contraceptive methods.  For example, if nonusers at high risk of unintended pregnancy and those using a traditional method were to use a modern method, the abortion rate could be expected to drop by 53{\%}.},

Eight types of measures are presented including total and age-specific fertility rates, general and crude birth rates, the mean number of children born to women, total marital fertility rates and marital duration, specific fertility rates, age at first birth, parity progression ratios, and birth intervals. These indicators are presented for the total country and by women?s residence, education, work status, and migration status, and by the education and occupation of their husband. Trends are examined for all countries using birth history data and for 22 countries by comparison with a previous DHS survey in each country. The Bongaarts proximate determinants indexes are calculated to assess the impact of these trends on fertility. The total fertility rate (TFR) for the three years preceding the survey in each country ranges from a high of 7.2 children per woman in Niger to 2.3 children per woman in Vietnam. Ten countries, Yemen and nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa, have TFRs of 6 children or more per woman. The high fertility in these countries is due mainly to early entry into motherhood and little behavior aimed at limiting births. Fertility limiting behavior including relatively high levels of contraceptive use and long intervals between births, is responsible for most of the low fertility levels in these countries. Fertility has declined in all countries except Colombia. },

abstract = {Cash crop expansion has been a major land use change in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Quantifying the determinants of cash crop expansion should provide deeper spatial insights into the dynamics and ecological consequences of cash crop expansion. This paper investigated the process of cash crop expansion in Hangzhou region (China) from 1985 to 2009 using remotely sensed data. The corresponding determinants (neighborhood, physical, and proximity) and their relative effects during three periods (1985-1994, 1994-2003, and 2003-2009) were quantified by logistic regression modeling and variance partitioning. Results showed that the total area of cash crops increased from 58,874.1 ha in 1985 to 90,375.1 ha in 2009, with a net growth of 53.5{\%}. Cash crops were more likely to grow in loam soils. Steep areas with higher elevation would experience less likelihood of cash crop expansion. A consistently higher probability of cash crop expansion was found on places with abundant farmland and forest cover in the three periods. Besides, distance to river and lake, distance to county center, and distance to provincial road were decisive determinants for farmers' choice of cash crop plantation. Different categories of determinants and their combinations exerted different influences on cash cropexpansion. The joint effects of neighborhood and proximity determinants were the strongest, and the unique effect of physical determinants decreased with time. Our study contributed to understanding of the proximate drivers of cash crop expansion in subtropical regions.},

abstract = {Rwanda has experienced a dramatic increase in contraceptive use during the last several years. The contraceptive prevalence rate has increased from 17 percent to 52 percent between 2005 and 2010. Unmet need for family planning has declined from 38 percent to 19 percent; and the total fertility rate from 6.1 to 4.6 births. These achievements occurred in the context where the Rwandan government has been promoting family planning through various strategies. This study described the family planning  initiatives in Rwanda and analyzed the 2005 and 2010 RDHS data to identify factors that contribute to the increase in contraceptive use. The Blinder -Oaxaca technique was used to decompose the contributions of women?s characteristics and their effects.  With a mean predicted increase of 0.342 in contraceptive prevalence rate between 2005 and 2010, the most increase (77 percent) results from changes in effects of women?s characteristics compared with changes in these characteristics (17 percent). Variables showing significant contribution in effects are women?s education, experience of child mortality, and place of residence. Regarding the compositional differences, effects are relatively greater for woman?s education, exposure to family planning messages in the media or at health facilities, husband?s desire for children compared with wife?s, and woman?s child mortality experience.

abstract = {Objectives: The study was conducted to determine trends of undernutrition and overnutrition among children age 0 to 59 months in Kenya and to analyze the determinants of child undernutrition and overnutrition. Data and methods: The study analysed data from the Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys (KDHS) 1993, 1998, 2003, and 2008-09. The study examined the trends in malnutrition over the four surveys and the relationship between malnutrition and selected household, maternal, and child characteristics. Results: The levels of stunting and underweight declined significantly (P{\textless}0.05) over the study period, by 4.6 percentage points. Nonetheless, stunting remains of high public health significance in Kenya, while underweight is of medium public health significance, as per the World Health Organization (WHO) classification (WHO 1995). Household wealth index, maternal education, maternal Body Mass Index (BMI), and size of the child at birth were significant determinants of child undernutrition. Conclusion and recommendations: The effect of wealth index, maternal education, and maternal BMI on child undernutrition changed over time, with wealth and maternal education having a reduced effect. The results suggest an emerging trend of a double burden of malnutrition, with stunted children whose mothers are overweight. The implementation of national nutrition strategies should focus on the vulnerable groups. Increasing women?s access to secondary and post-secondary education would go a long way in harnessing the potential of improved maternal and child nutrition in the country.},

abstract = {Family planning and maternal and child health services in Nepal are administered through stationary offices, mobile facilities, and door-to-door campaigns. Mobile facilities were introduced because of the remoteness of much of the population and the lack of local family planning facilities. Because most villagers were unwilling to come to family planning centers, the Nepal Family Planning and Maternal Child Health Board launched a door-to-door campaign to educate villagers about family planning and to distribute oral contraceptives and condoms. Four methods of family planning were initially introduced?sterilization, the IUD, pills, and condoms?and were offered by both the government and non-government sectors. Injectables were introduced in 1973 on an experimental basis in one district, and were gradually made available in other parts of Nepal.  Data from the 2006 NDHS show that 25 percent of currently married women in Nepal have an unmet need for family planning with 9 percent expressing a need for spacing and 15 percent a need for limiting. There has been a decline in the unmet need for family planning over the past ten years, with unmet need in 2006 being 22 percent lower than it was in 1996. There was a 34 percent decrease in the proportion of women with unmet need for spacing while the proportion of women with an unmet need for limiting decreased by 11 percent. On the whole, these trends are positive because they show a couple?s increasing ability to achieve their childbearing goals.},

abstract = {As the goals of international agricultural research move beyond increasing food production to the broader aims of reducing poverty, both agricultural research and studies of its impact become more complex. Yet examining the magnitude and mechanisms through which different types of agricultural research are able to help the poor is essential, not only to evaluate claims for continued funding of such research, but more importantly, to guide future research in ways that will make the greatest contribution to poverty reduction. This paper reports on the approach used in a multicountry study of the poverty impact of research programs under the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The studies use an expanded understanding of poverty that goes beyond income- or consumption-based headcounts or severity measures, to consider many other factors that poor people in different contexts define as contributing to their vulnerability, poverty, and well-being. The sustainable livelihoods framework provides a common conceptual approach to examining the ways in which agricultural research and technologies fit (or sometimes do not fit) into the livelihood strategies of households or individuals with different types of assets and other resources, strategies that often involve multiple activities undertaken at different times of the year. Applying this framework requires interdisciplinary research and a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. This paper reports on the conceptual framework, methods, and findings to date of these studies. The paper provides an overview of the sustainable livelihoods approach, how it can be applied to agricultural research, and describes detailed methods and results from five case studies: (1) modern rice varieties in Bangladesh; (2) polyculture fishponds and vegetable gardens in Bangladesh; (3) soil fertility management practices in Kenya; (4) hybrid maize in Zimbabwe; and (5) creolized maize varieties in Mexico. Applying the sustainable livelihoods approach highlights the multilayered interactions between technologies and the vulnerability context of households, their asset base, intervening institutions, and livelihood strategies. However, additional aspects of culture, power, and history need to be integrated with the framework to understand the role of agricultural research in the lives of the poor. Additional explicit attention must be given to the implications of gender, ethnicity, class, or other types of social differentiation. Although this approach is more difficult for research than conventional single-disciplinary analyses, it leads to a more complete understanding that can help develop technologies that better fit in with complex livelihood strategies, especially of the poor.},

Local to national-scale interventions to promote sustainable land use may have unintended effects owing to a displacement of land use within and across countries. Such leakage or 'indirect land use change' critically depends on international geographies of trade. Computing various material flows and environmental indicators embodied in international trade highlights the differences between producer and consumer-based biophysical accounting. Causal attribution of the links between material and monetary flows across countries, and actual land changes and environmental impacts at local level requires a combination of economic simulation models, statistical studies, place-based empirical studies, value chain analyses, and biophysical accounting. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The projected size and spatial distribution of the future population are important drivers of global change and key determinants of exposure and vulnerability to hazards. Spatial demographic projections are widely used as inputs to spatial projections of land use, energy use, and emissions, as well as to assessments of the impacts of extreme events, sea level rise, and other climate-related outcomes. To date, however, there are very few global-scale, spatially explicit population projections, and those that do exist are often based on simple scaling or trend extrapolation. Here we present a new set of global, spatially explicit population scenarios that are consistent with the new Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed to facilitate global change research. We use a parameterized gravity-based downscaling model to produce projections of spatial population change that are quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections for the SSPs and qualitatively consistent with assumptions in the SSP narratives regarding spatial development patterns. We show that the five SSPs lead to substantially different spatial population outcomes at the continental, national, and sub-national scale. In general, grid cell-level outcomes are most influenced by national-level population change, second by urbanization rate, and third by assumptions about the spatial style of development. However, the relative importance of these factors is a function of the magnitude of the projected change in total population and urbanization for each country and across SSPs. We also demonstrate variation in outcomes considering the example of population existing in a low-elevation coastal zone under alternative scenarios.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: Since 2009, the Burkina Faso government has launched a national policy to empower women and to better integrate gender equity in policies, actions, and programs. Research findings on women?s empowerment to support this policy are scarce, however. This paper therefore explores how socioeconomic differences shape two aspects of  women?s empowerment in the cultural and social context of Burkina Faso, namely decision-making in the household and experience of domestic violence. Reducing levels of domestic violence and improving women?s participation are important to empowering women.  Methods: Women?s participation in decision-making was assessed through three measures: involvement in decisions on woman?s own health care, involvement in decisions on major household purchases, and involvement in decisions on visits to family or relatives. Using binary logistic regression, we assessed how women?s socioeconomic characteristics shape each of the three outcome variables of decision-making, and each of four outcome variables of domestic violence?physical, emotional, and sexual violence, and psychological pressure. The study analyzed data for 9,141 cohabiting or married women who successfully completed the interview on domestic violence from the 2010 Burkina Faso Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).  Results: Findings show low levels of decision-making even among educated women and women working for cash, but also very low prevalence of domestic violence. Participation in all the three aspects of decision-making is positively associated with working for cash. The more education women have, the greater their involvement is in decision-making for their own health care and for family visiting. Household wealth status has a much weaker association with involvement in decision-making. Women?s experience of physical, emotional, and sexual violence by their husbands/partners generally is weakly related to socioeconomic characteristics. Only the richest women and to a lesser extent women with formal education are significantly more likely to experience psychological pressure.},

abstract = {Efforts to promote popular participation in forest management in Sub-Saharan Africa have faced many obstacles and disappointments. Although promises of improvements in relation to forest management, rural livelihoods and local enfranchisement have been achieved in some cases, accounts of frustration outnumber those of success. Focusing on participation through democratic decentralization (namely the transfer of meaningful discretionary powers to local representative authorities), this paper reviews recent empirical studies on the outcomes of popular participation in forest management. The implementation of decentralization of forestmanagement, and ecological, livelihood and democracy outcomes are examined, and misconceptions in analyses of decentralized forestry are explored. The expected benefits of democratic decentralization within forestry are rarely realized because democratic decentralization is rarely established. In most cases, local authorities do not represent the local population or their space of discretion is so narrow that they have little effect on management. There is little official localmanagement taking place, even under so-called decentralized or participatory management arrangements. If ever significant space for local discretion under democratic authorities is created, researchers will have the opportunity to study whether democratic decentralization can deliver the theoretically promised positive outcomes. Nevertheless, some cases shed light on effects of local decision making. Three general observations are made on effects of decentralization. First, environmental, livelihood and democracy objectives are not always mutually reinforcing, and under some circumstances they may be at odds. Second, environmental effects of improved forest management often result in benefits accruing to distant or higher-scale aggregate populations, while local communities carry the costs. Third, poor peoples' use of natural resources to maintain their livelihoods often ∗Correspondence: Dr J. C. Ribot e-mail: ribot@illinois.edu conflicts with profit and revenue interests of local elites, national commercial interests and governments. A negotiated minimum social and environmental standards approach to decentralization of forest management may safeguard essential ecological functions and at the same time protect essential livelihood and economic values of forests at all scales of society. The remainder of decisions, such as how forests are used, by whom and for what, could then be safely placed at the discretion of responsive local representatives.},

In addition, mean plant height, and mean biomass and grain production per area as well as per plant were higher at the outside edge of tree crowns than in the middle of the field.

Top soils were also richer in organic carbon and potassium around tree crowns than in the middle of blocks. Sorghum performance in the zone under and around canopies was projected at field scale and compared with central transect controls. Grain production in karite parklands was higher with trees of mean crown radii of 225 to 275 cm and average densities of 12 and 31 trees/ha than in areas without trees.

abstract = {Computational models of lexical semantics, such as latent semantic analysis, can automatically generate semantic similarity measures between words from statistical redundancies in text. These measures are useful for experimental stimulus selection and for evaluating a model's cognitive plausibility as a mechanism that people might use to organize meaning in memory. Although humans are exposed to enormous quantities of speech, practical constraints limit the amount of data that many current computational models can learn from. We follow up on previous work evaluating a simple metric of pointwise mutual information. Controlling for confounds in previous work, we demonstrate that this metric benefits from training on extremely large amounts of data and correlates more closely with human semantic similarity ratings than do publicly available implementations of several more complex models. We also present a simple tool for building simple and scalable models from large corpora quickly and efficiently.},

abstract = {Objectives This study aims to improve the understanding of the relationship between exposure to floods and malnutrition in children aged 6-59 months in rural India. Research has focused exclusively on Bangladeshi children, and few controlled epidemiological studies are available. Method A community-based cross-sectional study of child nutritional status was carried out in 14 flooded and 18 non-flooded villages of Jagatsinghpur district (Orissa) within one month of the September 2008 floods, and similarly affected by flooding in August 2006. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 757 households in the flooded villages and 816 in the non-flooded communities. Data used in this study were from those households with children aged 6-59 months. In total, 191 and 161 children were measured, respectively. The association between various malnutrition indicators and the exposure to floods was assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Adjusted analyses revealed that children in flooded households were more likely stunted compared with those in non-flooded ones (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.60; 95{\%} CI 1.05 to 2.44). The prevalence of underweight was also higher in children living in the flooded communities (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.86; 95{\%} CI 1.04 to 3.30). Further analyses found that the 26-36-month flooded cohort, thus those children younger than 1 year during the precedent flood in August 2006, attained the largest difference in levels of stunting compared with the unexposed group of the same age. Conclusion Exposure to floods is associated with long-term malnutrition in these rural communities of Orissa, India. Children exposed to floods during their first year of life presented higher levels of chronic malnutrition. Long-term malnutrition prevention programmes after floods should be implemented in flood-prone areas.},

abstract = {Production ecology and conservation biology have long focused on providing the knowledge base for intensive food production and biodiversity conservation, respectively. With increasing global food insecurity and continuing biodiversity decline, we show that the largely separate development of these fields is counterproductive. Scenario analyses suggest that feeding the world is possible without further encroachment of agriculture into natural ecosystems. Without ignoring the necessary demographic, socio-economic, institutional and governance requirements, we make the case for a science that develops the best ecological means to produce food in a way that has substantially less negative effects on biodiversity and associated ecosystem services and, indeed, should be able to contribute to their persistence and enhancement. Recent developments in trait-based ecology should soon make it possible to adapt and (re-)design agroecosystems to meet both goals of biodiversity conservation and food security. However, there are real tensions between, on the one hand, the opportunity costs of biodiversity conservation (for direct use and for conversion to agriculture) and on the other hand, the ecosystem service values and option values associated with biodiversity. We elaborate the management of plant genetic resources as a metaphor of the tensions between such values of biodiversity and ecosystem services in general. We conclude that significant changes in policies, institutions and practices are necessary to make advances in ecology work for reconciling biodiversity conservation and food security. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Access to and quality of health services are key determinants in utilization of health services and consequently, health outcomes. By linking DHS household data and health facility survey data, this paper explores the relationship between the service environment (service availability and readiness to provide a service) and utilization and quality of health care obtained in several health areas in Haiti and Malawi. The health areas included are family planning, maternal health care, child care, and HIV testing services in Haiti, and malaria-related health care services in Malawi. Geographically appropriate buffer zones around each cluster were determined based on area of residence?metropolitan, other urban, and rural areas in Haiti and urban and rural areas in Malawi. For each health area, data from the facilities within the buffer were summarized to cluster level to measure the cluster?s service environment relative to the health area included in the buffer zone. These cluster-level data were then linked to individual women in the household surveys. As expected, for all the health services examined in Haiti, clusters in the metropolitan area were linked to a much greater number of health facilities than clusters in other urban and rural areas. For most health areas, a significant association was found in rural areas (and other urban areas in Haiti) between access to or readiness of service provision and utilization of health services. The relationship does not hold however in the metropolitan area in Haiti; more precise measurements of the health service environment would be needed for areas with both high density of health facilities and population. },

abstract = {In Ethiopia, women?s participation in their own matters and women?s benefit from social, economic and political spheres is low. Traditional, social and economic values constrain the rights of women and their opportunities to direct their own lives or participate in and contribute to community and national development (Bogalech and Mengistu, 2007). Gender imbalances exist in the division of labour, access to resources, distribution of income, and decision-making. In the history of Ethiopia, women are primarily tasked with food production and other household level activities. Rights to land, credit, and other productive resources are difficult for women to attain. In 1993, the government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) issued the National Ethiopian Policy on Women and granted equal rights for women under the constitution. Moreover, a new family law was recently instituted focusing on the advancement of women, affirmative action, and provision for higher education, employment and promotion in the workplace (FDRE, 1993). The 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) collected data related to women?s empowerment and contraceptive use, which provides an excellent opportunity to study this relationship in the Ethiopian context. The various dimensions of empowerment ?economic, socio-cultural, familial/interpersonal, legal, political and psychological? may each influence the reproductive health of women. Despite high fertility and a high unmet need for family planning the country contraceptive prevalence rate for married women is very low (28.6{\%}). This study will explore the relationship between major dimensions of women?s empowerment and their use of contraception.},

abstract = {This report is an analysis of recent trends in abortion and contraception in 12 countries of central Asia and eastern Europe?Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan?where abortion had long been a major if not the principal method of birth control. A cross-sectional analysis of 18 countries shows a very high negative correlation between abortion and the use of modern contraceptive methods but a moderately high positive correlation between abortion and the use of traditional contraceptive methods. In a series of simulation models, the implications for further reductions in the prevalence of abortion are estimated. For example, if the women currently using modern methods of contraception were joined by those currently using traditional methods, abortion rates on average could be reduced by 23 percent; if women classified as having unmet need for family planning were also added to this group, abortion rates could be reduced by as much as 55 percent. The report also examines some of the main covariates of the use of modern contraception and abortion, as well as attitudes toward abortion. Multivariate analyses using a standard set of variables for all countries highlights the importance of age, urban residence, and education. The main conclusions are that there is strong evidence that modern contraceptive methods are replacing abortion as the primary means of family planning. At the same time, there will be continuing if not increasing pressure to avoid unintended pregnancies, which often end in abortion.   },

@article{Kremen2007,
abstract = {Many ecosystem services are delivered by organisms that depend on habitats that are segregated spatially or temporally from the location where services are provided. Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90{\%} of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context.},

abstract = {This study focuses on unmet need in Ghana over a decade, using information gathered in the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys (GDHS) conducted in 1988, 1993, and 1998. Although use of contraception increased noticeably between 1988 and 1993 (from 13 to 20 percent), use of family planning increased by only 2 percentage points between 1993-1998. However, during this decade, there was a shift from a need for spacing toward a need for limiting.  Nevertheless, the potential demand for spacing far exceeds the demand for limiting by 2.5 times in 1988 and 1.5 times in 1993 and in 1998. The total demand for family planning increased by nearly 29{\%} between 1988-1993 but declined by 3{\%} between 1993-1998. During the same period, the demand satisfied increased by 22{\%} in the first five-year period, but by only 12{\%} in the second. Even more striking is the fact that programmes in 1988 were not meeting the contraceptive needs of 7 in 10 women, and ten years later, they were still not meeting the needs of 6 in 10 women. While the statistical relationship between unmet need, levels of abortion, and contraceptive prevalence is unclear, the fact that nearly one in four Ghanaian women age 15-19 has experienced early pregnancy losses may indicate that young women are resorting to other means of controlling unwanted pregnancies.},

abstract = {Given its high dependence on rainfed agriculture and its comparatively low adaptive capacity, Africa is frequently invoked as especially vulnerable to climate change. Within Africa, there is likely to be considerable variation in vulnerability to climate change both between and within countries. This paper seeks to advance the agenda of identifying the hot spots of what we term “climate security” vulnerability, areas where the confluence of vulnerabilities could put large numbers of people at risk of death from climate-related hazards. This article blends the expertise of social scientists and climate scientists. It builds on a model of composite vulnerability that incorporates four “baskets” or processes that are thought to contribute to vulnerability including: (1) physical exposure, (2) population density, (3) household and community resilience, and (4) governance and political violence. Whereas previous iterations of the model relied on historical physical exposure data of natural hazards, this paper uses results from regional model simulations of African climate in the late 20th century and mid-21st century to develop measures of extreme weather events—dry days, heat wave events, and heavy rainfall days—coupled with an indicator of low-lying coastal elevation. For the late 20th century, this mapping process reveals the most vulnerable areas are concentrated in Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger, Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan, with pockets in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mauritania, and Sierra Leone. The mid 21st century projection shows more extensive vulnerability throughout the Sahel, including Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, northern Nigeria, Niger, and across Sudan.},

abstract = {Understanding the causes and consequences of pollinator declines is a priority in ecological research. However, across much of the globe we have a poor understanding of pollinator assemblages, population trends and the ecological and economic importance of particular pollinators, due to a marked geographic bias in research effort. Here, we show that almost half the data cited in thirteen recent meta-analyses, which ask important and diverse questions in pollination ecology, were collected in just five countries: Australia, Brazil, Germany, Spain and the USA. In contrast, the entire continent of Africa contributed only 4{\%} of the data. We believe that the consequences of this geographic bias are severe. Foremost, pollinator assemblages (and possibly their sensitivity to ecological drivers) can greatly vary among these regions. In addition, many communities that rely on pollinators, bees in particular, for food security and wealth generation are in geographic regions where our understanding of pollination is poor. Collecting accurate information on pollinator populations in data deficient areas will allow us to identify vulnerable populations and species and so better target conservation measures. Moreover, it will help us to determine if our current understanding of pollinator losses, based on data collected in a few locations and on the species that predominate in those regions, is representative of the wide diversity of ecosystems. We propose means of collecting such data given socioeconomic constraints. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

The smooths offer several advantages: (i) they have one wiggliness penalty per covariate and are hence invariant to linear rescaling of covariates, making them useful when there is no "natural" way to scale covariates relative to each other; (ii) they have a useful tuneable range of smoothness, unlike single-penalty tensor product smooths that are scale invariant; (iii) the relatively low rank of the smooths means that they are computationally efficient; (iv) the penalties on the smooths are easily interpretable in terms of function shape; (v) the smooths can be generated completely automatically from any marginal smoothing bases and associated quadratic penalties, giving the modeler considerable flexibility to choose the basis penalty combination most appropriate to each modeling task; and (vi) the smooths can easily be written as components of a standard linear or generalized linear mixed model, allowing them to be used as components of the rich family of such models implemented in standard software, and to take advantage of the efficient and stable computational methods that have been developed for such models. A small simulation study shows that the methods can compare favorably with recently developed smoothing spline ANOVA methods.},

A total of 805 million people are undernourished worldwide and malnutrition affects nearly every country on the planet. Despite impressive productivity increases, there is growing evidence that conventional agricultural strategies fall short of eliminating global hunger, as well as having long-term ecological consequences. Forests can play an important role in complementing agricultural production to address the Sustainable Development Goals on zero hunger. Forests and trees can be managed to provide better and more nutritionally-balanced diets, greater control over food inputs—particularly during lean seasons and periods of vulnerability (especially for marginalised groups)—and deliver ecosystem services for crop production. However forests are undergoing a rapid process of degradation, a complex process that governments are struggling to reverse. $\backslash$t$\backslash$t $\backslash$t$\backslash$t $\backslash$t$\backslash$t $\backslash$t$\backslash$t $\backslash$t$\backslash$t $\backslash$t$\backslash$t $\backslash$t$\backslash$t $\backslash$t$\backslash$tThis volume provides important evidence and insights about the potential of forests to reducing global hunger and malnutrition, exploring the different roles of landscapes, and the governance approaches that are required for the equitable delivery of these benefits.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global climate change is anticipated to reduce future cereal yields and threaten food security, thus potentially increasing the risk of undernutrition. The causation of undernutrition is complex, and there is a need to develop models that better quantify the potential impacts of climate change on population health.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: We developed a model for estimating future undernutrition that accounts for food and nonfood (socioeconomic) causes and can be linked to available regional scenario data. We estimated child stunting attributable to climate change in five regions in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2050.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used current national food availability and undernutrition data to parameterize and validate a global model, using a process-driven approach based on estimations of the physiological relationship between a lack of food and stunting. We estimated stunting in 2050 using published modeled national calorie availability under two climate scenarios and a reference scenario (no climate change).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We estimated that climate change will lead to a relative increase in moderate stunting of 1-29{\%} in 2050 compared with a future without climate change. Climate change will have a greater impact on rates of severe stunting, which we estimated will increase by 23{\%} (central SSA) to 62{\%} (South Asia).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Climate change is likely to impair future efforts to reduce child malnutrition in South Asia and SSA, even when economic growth is taken into account. Our model suggests that to reduce and prevent future undernutrition, it is necessary to both increase food access and improve socioeconomic conditions, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions.},

The Sahel is a major global agroecological region and its success in adaptation will influence the achievement of the global Millennium Development Goals. From simple typologies of adaptation strategies, our understanding of adaptive capacity has evolved over time (with accumulating observations) into a contextual model which places drought management at the center of a development process.

Poverty limits options for adaptation to unpredictable weather and resultant food insecurity; these concerns are particularly salient in an era of climate change, which threatens to roll back years of development gains. Examining the association between the growing environment and child survival and nutrition is important in this context. Using NASA's satellite remote sensing data with Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from four West African countries (Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Benin), we assess the association between a climate-related environmental variable (vegetation index - NDVI) and child survival and nutrition. NDVI had a positive association with child survival and nutrition in countries with a wide distribution of NDVI values. NDVI was more likely to be positively associated with wasting rather than stunting. We find that environmental factors can be important for child survival and nutrition outcomes in specific contexts. Additional research is needed to further explore the ways NDVI can be used to inform our understanding of the environment's impact on child survival and nutrition.},

Methods: Self-reported HIV status was compared with HIV serostatus obtained from blood test results. Among HIV-positive respondents with HIV-negative self-reports a simulation was conducted using estimates of HIV incidence and time since last HIV test to predict the percentage of respondents likely to have seroconverted since their last test. Finally, the impact of the validity of data on self-reported HIV status on service coverage indicators is assessed. Results: A total of 40 percent of HIV-positive women and 36 percent of HIV-positive men in Malawi and 32 percent of HIV-positive women and 24 percent of HIV positive men in Uganda reported that they had been tested for HIV, had received the result, and the result was HIV-negative. Among respondents who were HIV-positive on the survey blood test, the percentage likely to have seroconverted since their last HIV test was estimated at 1 percent or lower among women and men in both surveys. Conclusions: There is evidence of substantial underreporting of positive HIV status among respondents who are likely to know they have HIV. The low validity of data on self-reported HIV status will affect indicators of service use by PLHIV and estimates of eligibility for ART based on CD4 testing.},

abstract = {Focusing on the most impoverished populations, we critically review and synthesise key themes from dominant frameworks for assessing the relationship between well-being and ecosystem services in developing countries. This requires a differentiated approach to conceptualising well-being that appropriately reflects the perspectives of the poorest-those most directly dependent on ecosystem services, and their vulnerability to external and policy-driven environmental change. The frameworks analysed draw upon environmental sciences, economics, psychology, sociology, and anthropology, and were selected on the basis of their demonstrated or potential ability to illustrate the relationship between environmental change and human well-being, as well as their prevalence in real world applications. Thus, the synthesis offered here is informed by the various theoretical, methodological, and hermeneutical contributions from each field to the notion of well-being. The review highlights several key dimensions that should be considered by those interested in understanding and assessing the impact of environmental change on the well-being of the world's poorest people: the importance of interdisciplinary consideration of well-being, the need for frameworks that integrate subjective and objective aspects of well-being, and the central importance of context and relational aspects of well-being. The review is of particular interest to those engaged in the post-2015 development agenda.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The influence of seasonality on food security and nutritional status is widely accepted. However, research has typically focused on rural households and has not explored the specific mechanisms underlying seasonal effects. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of seasonality in determining the food security and nutritional status of low-income urban households and to isolate specific pathways through which seasonality has its impact. METHODS: Secondary panel data from CARE/IFPRI were utilized. Three rounds of data were collected from approximately 600 households in low-income areas of Dinajpur, Bangladesh, from 2002 through 2003, twice during the monsoon season and once in the dry season. Household-level surveys collected data on income and expenditure, employment, urban agriculture, health, and assets. Height and weight measurements were taken from children between the ages of 6 and 72 months. Paired t-tests and logistic fixed-effects modeling were then used to explore the role of seasonality. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of food insecurity, wasting, and inadequate growth were all significantly higher during the monsoon season as compared with the dry season. Dietary diversity and lost work due to the weather were identified as specific pathways through which season affected household food security. However, mechanisms hypothesized to contribute to seasonal declines in nutritional status, such as child illness, were not found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: Season had a significant effect on both food security and nutritional status in Dinajpur, with households consistently worse off during the monsoon season. Initiatives to promote food market development, support employment during the hunger season, and prevent seasonal declines in nutritional status should be implemented.},

Respondents who reported seeing the education campaign's interpretive graphic panels and informative films showed a significantly higher aggregate increase in their understanding of biodiversity and actions to protect it as compared to respondents who did not see the campaign materials. These findings reaffirm the value of education at zoos and aquariums to engage members of the public with biodiversity-related issues.

The typical enterprises and start-ups which emerge in this sector tend to be small-scale and family owned. We claim that there is a large unused potential for NWFP to support rural development and increase incomes of land owners and rural enterprises. In this article, we study what makes selected and so far successful product innovations in NWFPs special and subsequently what were the factors that supported their development and marketing? These questions we study at hand of four empirical innovative case studies in four European rural areas. We come to the conclusion that the entrepreneurs show some common features in the ways they started their business. However, they have applied individual strategies for the realisation of their own ideas. In line with recommendations from recent literature on creating innovations, all of them have used some "external" support, but at very different levels: They range from monetary support and consultation of effective support organisations to personal non-monetary exchange-relationships in social networks within a communal area. Our results contribute to an understanding of entrepreneurial behaviour as a very individual and context-specific undertaking on the one hand and as a "universal" activity with common features and attributes on the other.},

Proximate Determinants of Fertility Framework. The data is taken from the three Demographic and Health Surveys undertaken in 2000, 2005 and 2011. The results show that fertility has been declining in the last few years. But this decline is not uniform. Among the regions, Tigray, Amhara, Oromiya and SNNP show a decline in fertility, whereas, Somali and Afar have an increasing trend. In the remaining regions, fertility is stalled or changing very slowly. Fertility is inversely related to the educational level and the wealth status of women. By application of the Bongaarts? model we identify marriage as the most important factor affecting fertility in urban areas as a whole and specifically in Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa and Harari. Postpartum insusceptibility is identified as the main inhibitor in rural areas and in the Tigray, Amhara and Oromiya regions. The effect of contraception is showing an increasing trend in all the regions, with the exception of Somali and Afar. It has the strongest impact in the highly urbanized areas such as Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa cities and the Harari region.

@article{Robichaud2009,
abstract = {Swidden agriculture, or shifting cultivation, is variously viewed as a great environmental threat or a sustainable system of land use. In Laos, swidden has long been considered the primary driver of forest loss nationwide, but the assessment is based exclusively on studies from the north of country, where deforestation is most severe. National policies to control swidden have percolated down to management of one of the largest nature reserves in the region, Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area (NNT NPA) in the Annamite Mountains of central Laos. In NNT NPA, swidden's presumed unsustainability and deleterious impact on forest cover is an untested assumption. We tested it by methods of historical ecology, tracing the patterns of NNT's forest cover and human settlement over the past several decades. Principal sources of data were topographical maps dating to 1943, and Landsat images from 1976, 1989, and 2001. The The analysis shows that, although NNT has been inhabited by swidden cultivators for hundreds of years, it retained more than 95{\%} forest cover until the 1960s–early 1970s. Subsequently, a post-Vietnam War release of human population, possibly coupled with government encouragement of agricultural expansion, precipitated a decline in forest of 0.5{\%}/year until the 1980s. Curiously, this was followed by stability or an increase (ca. 0.3{\%}/year) in forest cover into the current century, even as NNT's human population continued to grow and as forest declined in Laos overall at 1.7{\%}/year, and in two protected areas near NNT at more than 3{\%}/year. A combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors probably account for the stability of NNT's forest cover despite recent population growth. First are cultural propensities for sedentariness and livelihoods with relatively low environmental impact among the ethnic groups inhabiting NNT. Since at least the 1940s, there have been remarkably few changes in the number or location of villages in NNT (and despite upheavals during the Vietnam War). Clearly, “shifting cultivation” is not equivalent to shifting populations. The extent of cleared forest in NNT has remained almost entirely within a swidden–forest mosaic whose boundaries date back at least to the 1960s. Second, the last 20 years have seen an explosion in wildlife trade in the region, particularly of animals valued in traditional medicine. Income earned from wildlife trade may have allowed NNT's residents to purchase rice to feed growing populations, instead of clearing more forest to grow it. The situation presents a dilemma for conservationists—attempts to control local wildlife trade could push NNT's villagers to clear more forest swiddens, and vice versa. Controlling both simultaneously would probably have a negative impact on villagers' standard of living. As wildlife trade is a greater threat to NNT's biodiversity values than local systems of rotational swidden, management should focus first on reducing wildlife trade. In any case, forest conservation (and villagers' welfare) will benefit more from alleviation of of NNT's human population growth than control of its traditional agriculture; it was primarily a shift in demography, not in agricultural practices, that precipitated the post-war period of forest loss. Finally, attempts to reduce local access to swidden land should come only after better understanding of the current swidden systems is achieved, and proven alternatives have been established.},

abstract = {We are interested in estimating the average effect of a binary treatment on a scalar outcome. If assignment to the treatment is exogenous or unconfounded, that is, independent of the potential outcomes given covariates, biases associated with simple treatment-control average comparisons can be removed by adjusting for differences in the covariates. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that adjusting solely for differences between treated and control units in the propensity score removes all biases associated with differences in covariates. Although adjusting for differences in the propensity score removes all the bias, this can come at the expense of efficiency, as shown by Hahn (1998), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Robins, Mark, and Newey (1992). We show that weighting by the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score, rather than the true propensity score, leads to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect. We provide intuition for this result by showing that this estimator can be interpreted as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently incorporates the information about the propensity score.},

However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state.

The 2005 EDHS showed that, despite a minimum legal marriage of 18 years in Ethiopia, early marriage remains  common, with a median age at first marriage among women age 25-49 of 16.1 years. Almost all pregnancies in Ethiopia occur within marriage, and the median age at first birth is about 17 years. Levels of contraceptive use are low, at 15{\%} among married women of reproductive age. The study measured the percentage of early teenage pregnancy by background characteristics of women age 17-24 in 2000 and 2005. The association of different background characteristics with early teenage pregnancy in 2000 and 2005 was ascertained using odds ratios with their confidence intervals in logistic regression analysis. Despite efforts to curb early marriage in Ethiopia and improve adolescent reproductive health services, early teenage pregnancy among young women age 17-24 increased between 2000 and 2005. The analysis found a statistically significant increase in early teenage pregnancy between the two survey years among women who were uneducated, in minority Christianity denominations, belonging to minority ethnic groups, and members of households in the poor and rich wealth terciles. In both surveys, the odds of early teenage pregnancy were significantly lower among women age 17-24 with more education. To address the problem of early teenage pregnancy, stronger measures should be taken to implement of the official minimum age at first marriage, and more effort should be exerted to change the cultural tradition of early marriage, which is a root cause of the problem. In addition to increasing girls? enrollment in secondary schools, the government of Ethiopia should scale up adult education programs for out-of-school young women, with more emphasis on reproductive health issues in the curriculum.},

These findings make a case for strengthening prevention programs in sub-Saharan Africa with a range of efforts to promote safer sexual behavior. The study also highlights large differentials between women and men in a number of HIV-related indicators, and wide variations among the 23 countries studied in the levels of and recent changes in HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.

This study examines the income from NTFPs and the dependency on these of different socio-economic groups in Northern Benin. Using survey data from 230 households of two villages, we firstly compared incomes of five different ethnic groups being differentiated by their traditional source of livelihood and regional provenance. Secondly, we investigated disparities between three income groups. On average, income from NTFPs accounted for 39{\%} of total household income and had a strong equalizing effect on it. However, the economic relevance of NTFPs differs between households: Poorer households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs in order to fulfill basic needs than wealthier households. However, the latter extract more NTFPs in quantitative terms and have significantly higher cash returns than poorer ones. This is mainly due to a significant greater land holding. Moreover, our study revealed that net income from NTFPs reflects traditional sources of livelihoods of different ethnic groups. In conclusion, both conservation and development strategies should take into consideration the socio-economic context of different beneficiaries of savanna woodland resources in order to apply appropriate measures to poverty reduction. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The importance of the role of local community forestry institutions towards forest conservation is exemplified through a comparison of two adjacent areas within the Central Yucatan Peninsular Region (CYPR) in which Land-Use Cover Change (LUCC) analyses were conducted. We also used logistic regression analyses to examine key environmental, socioeconomic and institutional drivers associated with deforestation. One of the areas, La Monta{\~{n}}a (LM) at Hopelchen, Campeche, is part of the northern section and buffer zone of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (CBR) as well as part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. LM is an agricultural forest frontier region economically dependent on productive activities. The other study, Zona Maya (ZM), found at the municipality of Felipe Carrillo Puerto in Quintana is characterized by having developed community-based forestry enterprises with world wide recognition. In addition, the major tourism industry in nearby Cancun and Riviera Maya provide an important source of off-farm labor and temporary migration. Results show contrasting annual deforestation rates among the two study areas, being greater in the Campeche site (0.7{\%} from 2000 to 2005) compared to Quintana Roo (-0.002{\%} from 2000 to 2004). Logistic regression results show that the occurrence of land clearing at LM is significantly related to demographic variables as well as soil-environment types and conservation status did not reveal to relate to LUCC processes at all. At Quintana Roo, despite twice the population density, population variables at large did not strongly correlate to forest clearing. Rather forest conservation or maintenance was shown to be influenced by local community forestry institutions and a landscape zoning provided by larger management goals from the part of the communities. Greater availability of wage labor for the prominent tourism economy may also reflect a lesser dependence on agriculture and contribute to the much lower deforestation rate. Nonetheless, results show that community forest management can play an effective role in forest conservation. We argue for a regional land use management approach as a conservation strategy in which local inhabitants are considered key actors.},

Common bibliometric indicators show that hydropower research publications sustain a rapid growth rate, English is the dominant language, and the hotspots of hydropower research can be concluded as "fish", "species", "climate", "emission", "lake", "sediment", "Turkey", etc. We established a 29-topic model to describe the intellectual structure of the 1726 articles, and employed cluster analysis and trend analysis to process the derived topics. We find that post construction issues of hydropower are more attractive for scholars than construction technology itself, and an interdisciplinary trend of hydropower research is emerging. The methodology reported in this study is expected to gain traction as a methodological strategy for energy research reviews and subsequently to promote energy policy making.},

This further analysis focuses on: trends in various dimensions of family planning since 2001 and 2006, on the unmet need for family planning that had been emphasized in a Further Analysis report based largely on the 2006 survey (Soumaila et al. 2009), and on multivariate analyses of characteristics associated with family planning. The analysis of trends throughout this report is complicated by the sampling problems in the most recent survey which, for reasons of security, excluded the three northern regions of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu and did not fully represent the region of Mopti. Comparability over time therefore requires excluding these regions in the total sample estimates. This exclusion is noted as the ?adjusted? totals. In the 2006 survey, the three northern regions comprised 10 percent of the total sample of women and Mopti was 14 percent. In regional trend analyses, Mopti is included but not in the adjusted totals.},

@book{Sen1983,
abstract = {The main focus of this book is on the causation of starvation in general and of famines in particular. The traditional analysis of famines concentrates on food supply. This is shown to be fundamentally defective—it is theoretically unsound, empirically inept, and dangerously misleading for policy. The author develops an alternative method of analysis—the 'entitlement approach', which concentrates on ownership and exchange. Aside from developing the underlying theory, the approach is used in a number of case studies of recent famines, including the Great Bengal Famine of 1943, the Ethiopian famines of 1973 and 1974, the Bangladesh famine of 1974, and the famines in the countries of the African Sahel in the 1970s. The book also provides a general analysis of the characterization and measurement of poverty. Various approaches used in economics, sociology, and political theory are critically examined. The predominance of distributional issues, including distribution between different occupational groups, links up the problem of conceptualizing poverty with that of analysing starvation. The book contains some technical economic analysis, but the text of the book has been kept as informal as possible, so that the text is accessible to the non-technical reader, and the main lines of reasoning and their applications to the case studies are easily followed. Technicalities and mathematical reasoning are confined to the four appendices, which (1) present a formal analysis of the notion of exchange entitlement, (2) provide illustrative models of exchange entitlement, (3) examine the problem of poverty measurement, and (4) analyse the pattern of famine mortality based on the Bengal famine of 1943.},

Based on more than 200 interviews, we unravel the complex dynamic mechanisms of changes in access to shea. We show that negotiations result in reduced access to shea for late comers as well as for people with a limited number of shea trees in their fields, since areas where shea is managed as a common-pool resource are becoming less accessible. However, we also demonstrate that late comers are not powerless in the face of first comers' claims to shea. Our results should help policy-makers and project-based activities concerning shea to focus more on issues related to access to this resource.},

abstract = {The study presents an analysis of the relationships between trends in age at marriage, trends in contraceptive use and fertility trends in 33 sub-Saharan African countries. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) provided all of the data on marriage, contraception and fertility. Median age at marriage was defined as the age at which half of a cohort is ever-married. Contraceptive use was defined as ever-use of modern contraception by age 40. Fertility was defined as cumulated fertility by age 40. Median age at marriage of synthetic cohorts increased by some 3.3 years between 1950 and 2005 in urban areas, and some 1.1 years in rural areas. Trends in age at marriage had little correlation with trends in level of education, or with trends in income per capita. Fertility trends also had virtually no correlation with trends in age at marriage in countries studied. Contraceptive use increased in all countries studied.  Trends in contraceptive use were highly correlated with fertility trends. Overall, in urban areas fertility was reduced by 49{\%} by year 2005, while ever-use of contraception reached 49{\%} of the population. In rural areas, fertility was reduced by 14{\%} by year 2005, while ever-use of contraception reached 28{\%} of the population. In multivariate analysis, trends in ever-use of contraception explained about half of fertility trends. In contrast, whatever the model, the role of age at marriage appeared small, explaining less than 10{\%} of fertility decline, and was further compounded by the emergence of premarital fertility, especially in urban areas.},

@article{Roudier2011,
abstract = {In West Africa, agriculture, mainly rainfed, is a major economic sector and the one most vulnerable to climate change. A meta-database of future crop yields, built up from 16 recent studies, is used to provide an overall assessment of the potential impact of climate change on yields, and to analyze sources of uncertainty.Despite a large dispersion of yield changes ranging from -50{\%} to +90{\%}, the median is a yield loss near -11{\%}. This negative impact is assessed by both empirical and process-based crop models whereas the Ricardian approach gives very contrasted results, even within a single study. The predicted impact is larger in northern West Africa (Sudano-Sahelian countries, -18{\%} median response) than in southern West Africa (Guinean countries, -13{\%}) which is likely due to drier and warmer projections in the northern part of West Africa. Moreover, negative impacts on crop productivity increase in severity as warming intensifies, with a median yield loss near -15{\%} with most intense warming, highlighting the importance of global warming mitigation.The consistently negative impact of climate change results mainly from the temperature whose increase projected by climate models is much larger relative to precipitation change. However, rainfall changes, still uncertain in climate projections, have the potential to exacerbate or mitigate this impact depending on whether rainfall decreases or increases. Finally, results highlight the pivotal role that the carbon fertilization effect may have on the sign and amplitude of change in crop yields. This effect is particularly strong for a high carbon dioxide concentration scenario and for C3 crops (e.g. soybean, cassava). As staple crops are mainly C4 (e.g. maize, millet, sorghum) in WA, this positive effect is less significant for the region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Employing the ecosystem service concept is intended to support the development of policies and instruments that integrate social, economic and ecological perspectives. In recent years, this concept has become the paradigm of ecosystem management. 2. The prolific use of the term 'ecosystem services' in scientific studies has given rise to concerns about its arbitrary application. A quantitative review of recent literature shows the diversity of approaches and uncovers a lack of consistent methodology. 3. From this analysis, we have derived four facets that characterise the holistic ideal of ecosystem services research: (i) biophysical realism of ecosystem data and models; (ii) consideration of local trade-offs; (iii) recognition of off-site effects; and (iv) comprehensive but critical involvement of stakeholders within assessment studies. 4. These four facets should be taken as a methodological blueprint for further development and discussion. They should critically reveal and elucidate what may often appear to be ad-hoc approaches to ecosystem service assessments. 5. Synthesis and applications: Based on this quantitative review, we provide guidelines for further development and discussions supporting consistency in applications of the ecosystem service concept as well as the credibility of results, which in turn can make it easier to generalise from the numerous individual studies.},

Because contraceptive use for birth limitation is the driving force for reducing high rates of population growth, a key question is whether the use for spacing leads to the use for limiting. In other words, does spacing behavior eventually result in a desire for fewer births? This report provides estimates of the proportion of Limiters who had been Spacers for 51 developing countries in the DHS program and finds that significant proportions of women who currently limit their fertility were Spacers in the past. Further, although there is no direct evidence that spacing experience reduces the number of children desired, multivariate analysis shows that Limiters who had been Spacers, in addition to being less likely to have had unwanted births, are less likely to have experienced the death of a child, are more likely to have higher education, and are more likely to have been exposed to mass media. },

We have disaggregated the data from 59 DHS surveys into 451regions of these countries?200 from sub-Saharan Africa and 251 from other countries. This approach not only increases the potential for statistical analysis but also increases the social and cultural homogeneity of the populations. The results of the regional analyses are quite consistent with those at the national level; both approaches clearly show a much lower association between the level of contraceptive practice and the total fertility rate in sub-Saharan Africa. A variety of explanations were statistically evaluated. The most important consideration appears to be the fact that the populations in sub-Saharan Africa were clearly at the beginning of their fertility transition and were being compared with Asian and Latin American populations at much  more advanced stages of the transition. By comparing the correlation for the same regions that were surveyed more than once, we are able to discern a clear trend in sub-Saharan Africa toward a higher correlation over time. The implication of this trend is that the association will eventually be the same in sub-Saharan Africa as elsewhere. },

abstract = {Agricultural ecosystems are actively managed by humans to optimize the provision of food, fiber, and fuel. These ecosystem services from agriculture, classified as provisioning services by the recent Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, depend in turn upon a web of supporting and regulating services as inputs to production (e.g., soil fertility and pollination). Agriculture also receives ecosystem dis-services that reduce productivity or increase production costs (e.g., herbivory and competition for water and nutrients by undesired species). The flows of these services and dis-services directly depend on how agricultural ecosystems are managed and upon the diversity, composition, and functioning of remaining natural ecosystems in the landscape. Managing agricultural landscapes to provide sufficient supporting and regulating ecosystem services and fewer dis-services will require research that is policy-relevant, multidisciplinary and collaborative. This paper focuses on how ecosystem services contribute to agricultural productivity and how ecosystem dis-services detract from it. We first describe the major services and dis-services as well as their key mediators. We then explore the importance of scale and economic externalities for the management of ecosystem service provision to agriculture. Finally, we discuss outstanding issues in regard to improving the management of ecosystem services and dis-services to agriculture. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This study examines the income from NTFPs and the dependency on these of different socio-economic groups in Northern Benin. Using survey data from 230 households of two villages, we firstly compared incomes of five different ethnic groups being differentiated by their traditional source of livelihood and regional provenance. Secondly, we investigated disparities between three income groups. On average, income from NTFPs accounted for 39{\%} of total household income and had a strong equalizing effect on it. However, the economic relevance of NTFPs differs between households: Poorer households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs in order to fulfill basic needs than wealthier households. However, the latter extract more NTFPs in quantitative terms and have significantly higher cash returns than poorer ones. This is mainly due to a significant greater land holding. Moreover, our study revealed that net income from NTFPs reflects traditional sources of livelihoods of different ethnic groups. In conclusion, both conservation and development strategies should take into consideration the socio-economic context of different beneficiaries of savanna woodland resources in order to apply appropriate measures to poverty reduction. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Drought in Africa has been extensively researched, particularly from meteorological, agricultural, and food security perspectives. However, the impact of drought on water security, particularly ground water dependent rural water supplies, has received much less attention. Policy responses have concentrated on food needs, and it has often been difficult to mobilize resources for water interventions, despite evidence that access to safe water is a serious and interrelated concern. Studies carried out in Ghana, Malawi, South Africa, and Ethiopia highlight how rural livelihoods are affected by seasonal stress and longer-term drought. Declining access to food and water is a common and interrelated problem. Although ground water plays a vital role in buffering the effects of rainfall variability, water shortages and difficulties in accessing water that is available can affect domestic and productive water uses, with knock-on effects on food consumption and production. Total depletion of available ground water resources is rarely the main concern. A more common scenario is a spiral of water insecurity as shallow water sources fail, additional demands are put on remaining sources, and mechanical failures increase. These problems can be planned for within normal development programs. Water security mapping can help identify vulnerable areas, and changes to monitoring systems can ensure early detection of problems. Above all, increasing the coverage of ground water-based rural water supplies, and ensuring that the design and siting of water points is informed by an understanding of hydrogeological conditions and user demand, can significantly increase the resilience of rural communities to climate variability.},

abstract = {Between 1993 and 1998, there was an increase in the use of contraceptives in the Philippines. Notable gains in modern method use were recorded, mainly for injectables and female sterilization. Women from poorer households and rural areas registered the most rapid gains in family planning use. The findings also suggest that efforts to raise levels of female schooling result in greater family planning use. The results also show that younger women tend to use contraceptives less.	 Employment of women and household wealth status have a positive relation with contraceptive use, especially for modern methods. Unemployed women are less likely to use contraceptives. The relation between the household wealth index and contraceptive use also demonstrates that women with a higher income more likely to use contraception than poor women. Contrary to expectations, spousal communication about family planning and geographic accessibility to service delivery points appear to be less critical in determining contraceptive use. Community attributes, as reflected by the type of residence and region, influence the use of contraception, although region is important only for modern methods. Women from rural areas are less likely to use contraceptives, although some improvement in rural prevalence is noted between 1993 and 1998. Modern method use improved substantially in Mindanao and areas of Luzon outside Manila over the same period. Women who were not visited by family planning field workers in the previous 12 months are less likely to use contraceptives.

abstract = {Total income and income from forest resources among rural dwellers in tropical forest regions are influenced not only by market access, prices, but also organizational, institutional, and social factors. These factors influence the diversity of resources to which the poor have access and result in specializations in livelihood strategies. We analyzed the relation between forest dependence and livelihood strategies in the Bolivian Amazon, applying the SLF. We tested for the differences across strategies with respect to financial, human, physical, social, and natural livelihood assets. Results show that forest income is highly related to cash income from Brazil nut, while income from agriculture and timber exploitation is associated with higher levels of education. Brazil nuts serve as a safety net and start-up capital for certain livelihood strategies in our study region. Livelihood strategies that are based on the commercialization of multiple products from forests and agriculture and services inside and outside communities depend less on forests. Livelihoods can be supported by investing in sustainable livelihood asset endowments. Our results demonstrate that activities that aim to support community forest management and to enhance household income should explicitly consider a differentiated support for different strategies. This will result in a more effective outcome of development efforts from which the poorest people would benefit most. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {PRELIMINARY FINDINGS Land degradation is a global environment and development issue. Up-to-date, quantitative information is needed to support policy and action for food and water security, economic development, environmental integrity and resource conservation. To meet this need, the Global Assessment of Land Degradation and Improvement (GLADA) uses remote sensing to identify degrading areas and areas where degradation has been arrested or reversed. This screening will be followed up within the parent LADA program by field investigations to establish the situation on the ground. Findings remain provisional until validated in the field. 1. Land degradation is defined as a long-term decline in ecosystem function and measured in terms of net primary productivity. The remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used as a proxy; its deviation from the norm may serve as an indicator of land degradation and improvement if other factors that may be responsible (climate, soil, terrain and land use) are accounted for. Rainfall effects may be accounted for by rain-use efficiency (NDVI per unit of rainfall) and residual trends of NDVI, temperature effects by energy-use efficiency (derived from annual accumulated temperature). Land degradation is indicated by a declining trend of climate-adjusted net primary productivity and land improvement by an increasing trend. Translation of NDVI to net primary productivity enables economic appraisal of land degradation. 2. Land degradation is cumulative – this is the global issue. The 1991 GLASOD assessment indicated that 15 per cent of the land surface was degraded; the present assessment identifies 24 per cent of land as degrading but the areas hardly overlap, which means that new areas are being affected. Some areas of historical land degradation have been so degraded that they are now stable - at stubbornly low levels of productivity. 3. Analysis of 23-year GIMMS NDVI data reveals a declining trend across some 24 per cent of the global land area. Spatial patterns and temporal trends of NDVI and rain-use efficiency are analysed for the period 1981-2003 at 8km resolution. Degrading areas are mainly in Africa south of the Equator, SE Asia and S China, N-Central Australia, the Pampas, and swaths of boreal forest in Siberian and N America. 4. Almost one fifth of degrading land is cropland - more than 20 per cent of all cultivated areas; 23 per cent is broadleaved forest, 19 per cent needle-leaved forests, 20-25 per cent rangeland. Cropland occupies only 12 per cent of the land area and forest only 28 per cent, so degradation is over-represented in both cropland and in forest globally. 5. Loss of carbon fixation from the atmosphere, associated with land degradation over the period, amounts to almost a thousand million tonnes. At a shadow price of {\$}50 per tonne, the cost is almost {\$}50 billion. The cost of land degradation is at least an order of magnitude greater in terms of emissions to the atmosphere though loss of soil organic carbon. 6. Some 16 per cent of the land area shows improvement. 18 per cent of the improving area is cropland (20 per cent of the total croplands), 23 per cent is forest and 43 per cent rangeland. 7. There is only a weak correlation with biophysical factors other than land cover: 78 per cent of degrading land is in humid regions, 8 per cent in the dry sub-humid, 9 per cent in the semi-arid, and 5 per cent in arid and hyper-arid regions. There is no obvious relationship between degrading land and the nature of soil or terrain – degradation is driven by management and catastrophic natural phenomena. 8. About 1.5 billion people depend directly on the degrading areas. There is a weak correlation between degrading land and rural population density but more detailed analysis of land use history is needed to tease out the underlying social and economic drivers.},

abstract = {Environmental service provision is increasingly discussed as a potential new venue for the simultaneous pursuit of development and natural resource conservation objectives, particularly among landowners in the low-income tropics. To date, most of the experience with such market-regulated mechanisms comes from water and forest projects in Latin America. Preliminary evidence suggests that participation of, and benefits to, small-scale land users are highly unequal and that the synergistic goals of poverty reduction and resource conservation through these emerging market mechanisms might be overly ambitious. This paper assesses the possibility of pro-poor environmental service provision through carbon sequestration among smallholders in the Sahel. It focuses on a case study in the small-scale, rain-fed agricultural systems of the Old Peanut Basin of Senegal. Based on a conceptual framework including economic, institutional, policy and livelihood factors, it assesses to the extent to which specific groups of farmers are able or willing to participate in and benefit from potential carbon offset programs. Finally, the paper stresses the need for adequate and equitable financial support and a careful rethinking of the institutional structures necessary to enhance rural livelihoods and natural resource management in drylands, with or without market-based environmental service programs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A variety of indicators are currently used for food security analysis, monitoring, and programming, and most agencies have their preferred variant on methods of data collection, aggregation, and analysis. This lack of consensus is reflected in an inefficient multiplicity of survey instruments collecting information on various dimensions of food and nutrition security, with tremendous variation in the content, quality, and quantity of the information collected. No single existing survey instrument will ever be able to collect all needed indicators at the desired periodicity, and no single institution has either the mandate or the ability to measure and monitor food security in its many dimensions on a global scale. However, with better coordination across institutions and survey efforts, the state of food security measurement worldwide can be greatly improved. This paper attempts to identify the elements of a strategy, built around a combination of short-term fixes and long-term methodological advancements, to reverse the existing trends of poor coordination and slow methodological innovation in food security measurement and monitoring. International focus on a small dashboard of indicators, collected on a regular basis by different stakeholders through a number of available data collection options, is feasible and can be partially achieved by repurposing existing surveys to better suit food security monitoring goals. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Bangladesh is very prone to flooding due to its location at the confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna (GBM) rivers and because of the hydro-meteorological and topographical characteristics of the basins in which it is situated. On average, annual floods inundate 20.5 per cent area of the country and this can reach as high as about 70 per cent during an extreme flood event. Floods cause serious damage to the economy of Bangladesh, a country with a low per capita income. Global warming caused by the enhanced greenhouse effect is likely to have significant effects on the hydrology and water resources of the GBM basins and might ultimately lead to more serious floods in Bangladesh. The use of climate change scenarios from four general circulation models as input into hydrological models demonstrates substantial increases in mean peak discharges in the GBM rivers. These changes may lead to changes in the occurrence of flooding with certain magnitude. Extreme flooding events will create a number of implications for agriculture, flood control and infrastructure in Bangladesh. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In multilevel analysis, the major restriction is often the higher-level sample size. In this paper, a simulation study is used to determine the influence of different sample sizes at the group level on the accuracy of the estimates (regression coefficients and variances) and their standard errors. In addition, the influence of other factors, such as the lowest-level sample size and different variance distributions between the levels (different intraclass correlations), is examined. The results show that only a small sample size at level two (meaning a sample of 50 or less) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors. In all of the other simulated conditions the estimates of the regression coefficients, the variance components, and the standard errors are unbiased and accurate.

abstract = {Despite the growing interest in Ecosystem-based Adaptation, there has been little discussion of how this approach could be used to help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change, while ensuring the continued provision of ecosystem services on which farming depends. Here we provide a framework for identifying which agricultural practices could be considered 'Ecosystem-based Adaptation' practices, and highlight the opportunities and constraints for using these practices to help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change. We argue that these practices are (a) based on the conservation, restoration or management of biodiversity, ecosystem processes or services, and (b) improve the ability of crops and livestock to maintain crop yields under climate change and/or by buffering biophysical impacts of extreme weather events or increased temperatures. To be appropriate for smallholder farmers, these practices must also help increase their food security, increase or diversify their sources of income generation, take advantage of local or traditional knowledge, be based on local inputs, and have low implementation and labor costs. To illustrate the application of this definition, we provide some examples from smallholders' coffee management practices in Mesoamerica. We also highlight three key obstacles that currently constrain the use of Ecosystem-based Adaptation practices (i) the need for greater understanding of their effectiveness and the factors that drive their adoption, (ii) the development supportive and integrated agriculture and climate change policies that specifically promote them as part of a broader agricultural adaptation program; and (iii) the establishment and maintaining strong and innovative extension programs for smallholder farmers. Our framework is an important starting point for identifying which Ecosystem-based Adaptation practices are appropriate for smallholder farmers and merit attention in international and national adaptation efforts.},

abstract = {Introduction: Afghanistan has long been recognized as having one of the highest levels of maternal mortality in the world. In Afghanistan an estimated 40{\%} to 50{\%} of women?s deaths during the childbearing years are  related to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. The present study uses nationally representative data to describe and interpret trends in coverage of three key maternal health care services across provinces in Afghanistan, in order to contribute to evidence-based maternal health care planning and effective strategies to improve maternal health care in the provinces of the country.  Method: This paper presents secondary analysis of data from the 2010 Afghanistan Mortality Survey (AMS). In order to assess maternal health care service utilization, this study examined women?s use of three essential maternal services: antenatal care (ANC), delivery care by a skilled birth attendant (SBA), and postnatal care (PNC). Two methods were used to compare coverage across provinces: first, provinces were compared in their overall coverage of maternal health services during the five years preceding the survey; and second, maternal health care utilization was disaggregated into one-year periods in order to examine trends in health care utilization by province during this five-year period.  Results: Nationally, 60{\%} of women reported that they received antenatal care from a skilled provider for their last live birth, 34{\%} reported that their last live birth was delivered by a skilled provider, and 23{\%} reported that they received postnatal care within two days following delivery of their last live birth. Eighteen percent of women received all three maternal services for their last live birth. Nationally, use of all three services increased by roughly 10{\%} over the five years preceding the survey, but the extent of progress varied considerably across province.  Conclusion: The study shows overall progress toward improving coverage of all three maternal health indicators (ANC, deliveries attended by SBAs, and PNC). This progress could be explained by substantial investments put in place during this period in reproductive health care and in rebuilding the health system. However, there is extensive variation in the extent of progress across provinces. Provinces with better maternal health care coverage and a higher rate of progress in coverage can be encouraged to share lessons learned from their experience with provinces with lower coverage and slower progress.},

abstract = {An estimated 26{\%} of current global child deaths can be attributed to various and modifiable environmental factors, which are addressed under multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study assesses future reductions in child mortality in relation to the achievement of environment-related SDG targets. It uses projections of health risk factors from the IMAGE 3.0 Integrated Assessment Model, based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), linked to a standard multi-state health model (GISMO), distinguishing risk factors, disease occurrence and cause-specific death. The study concludes that, on a global level, the SDG target on child mortality will not be achieved in any of the three SSP scenarios analysed, mainly due to persistent high mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. By 2030, environmental health risk factors – including childhood undernutrition, no access to improved drinking water and sanitation, no access to modern fuels and exposure to malaria – will still be responsible for 14{\%} to 16{\%} of total global child deaths (8{\%} to 10{\%} when excluding nutrition-related mortality). Under the middle-of-the-road SSP2 baseline scenario, achievement of the SDG targets on hunger, drinking water and sanitation and modern energy services, would avoid 433 thousand child deaths by 2030. If, in addition, also higher standards would be achieved for access to water and energy, as well as universal secondary female education and advanced malaria control, a total of 733 thousand child deaths is projected to be avoided by 2030 (444 thousand child deaths, when excluding nutrition-related mortality), which would reduce projected global child mortality by 13{\%}. Overall, more than 25{\%} of the child mortality reduction that is needed to achieve the SDG target in Sub-Saharan Africa can be achieved through SDG-related policies on food, water and energy. This requires integrated and intersectoral approaches to environmental health.},

abstract = {Benin is one of the sub-Saharan African countries where there is a decline in childhood mortality. This paper examines various socioeconomic factors and maternal and child care interventions that are likely to have influenced the level of infant and under-five mortality in Benin, using data from three DHS surveys implemented in 1996, 2001, and 2006.  Survival analysis is applied to the 2006 data to determine the important factors that have an impact on the levels of infant and child mortality in Benin. Then by using the changes in the prevalence of these factors, the proportion of change in the mortality rates between the surveys is estimated.  The analysis reveals that the significant predictors of infant mortality are mother?s education, vaccination, the preceding birth interval, the age of mother at birth, the multiplicity of birth, birth weight, antenatal care, antenatal tetanus toxoid injections, medical delivery assistance, and bed net possession. These predictors explain about 57{\%} of the reduction in infant mortality. It is evident from this analysis that bed net use is strongly associated with the reduction in childhood mortality, and that bed net distribution should continue to be increased. It is also important to ensure increasing coverage of vaccinations. Improving other health care such as medical delivery, antenatal care, and antenatal tetanus toxoid injections is essential to reducing the infant and under-five mortality.  Efforts to avoid short birth intervals and births to young mothers would also play increasingly important roles in reducing infant and under-five mortality.},

abstract = {Introduction:  HIV is one of the worst epidemics ever, with about 22.5 million people in sub-Saharan Africa living with the virus. The epidemic is extremely heterogenic and dynamic. HIV prevention depends upon a good understanding of population-specific transmission determinants. Therefore, this study of the magnitude and determinants of the recently observed decrease in HIV infection in Tanzania will help define the future direction of HIV interventions in the country. Methods: Data from the 2003/04 and 2007/08 AIDS indicator surveys from Mainland Tanzania were used in this analysis. In these surveys a multi-stage cluster sampling method utilizing two-stage sample design was employed to recruit participants age 15-49 from throughout the country. Socio-demographic, behavioral and biological determinants for HIV transmission were collected, and HIV testing was done to all consenting participants. In this analysis, data were restricted to Mainland Tanzania, people who reported to be sexually active, and people who had a valid HIV test result. A total sample of 3,944 men and 5,213 women from the 2003/04 survey and 3,708 men and 5,311 women from the 2007/08 survey were included in this analysis. Results: Apart from a significant increase between 2003/04 and 2007/08 in the proportion of people reporting having ever had an HIV test, other socio-demographic, behavioral and biological variables remained similar across the two surveys. Overall, HIV infection decreased by 14{\%} (from 7.9{\%} to 6.8{\%}) over the four years between surveys, but this decrease was only significant among urban males. In both surveys among both women and men, formerly married individuals were at higher HIV risk, In the 2007/08 survey, however, single women were 60{\%} less likely than married women to be infected. Risk of infection increased with wealth for both sexes and in both surveys. Risk was two to three times higher among rural residents compared with urban residents. In the 2007/08 survey educational attainment was associated with HIV infection in rural areas but not in urban areas. Having many lifetime sexual partners was a risk factor among both men and women, in both rural and urban areas, and in both surveys. Having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) was an important biological determinant for HIV infection in the 2007/08 survey, with twice the likelihood of infection for infected men and women compared with those uninfected. Male circumcision was associated with 60-80{\%} lower odds of HIV infection. Conclusion and recommendation: HIV prevalence is decreasing among men in urban areas of Tanzania. Overall, men and women have similar determinants of HIV transmission, as do rural and urban populations. However, the study identified a number of transmission determinants that varied by sex and by urban-rural residence across the two surveys. Hence, interventions must address specific determinants in order to be effective. Similarly, interventions must address urban and rural populations separately.},

abstract = {Climate change is widely expected to lead to changing rainfall variability and thus to changing frequency of drought. In places where drought is a major driver of agroecosystem dynamics, as in the extensive livestock grazing systems that dominate Africa's sprawling arid and semi-arid lands, changing rainfall variability can fundamentally alter human wealth dynamics. We use subjective livestock herd growth expectations data elicited from Boran pastoralists in southern Ethiopia to generate estimates of herd dynamics conditional on rainfall state. The climate state-conditional estimates permit simulation of herd dynamics under different rainfall patterns. The multiple herd size equilibria observed in multiple pastoralist household data sets from the region appear sensitive to climate regimes. Reduced rainfall variability that significantly reduces drought frequency would eliminate, in expectation, the poverty trap equilibrium that presently exists only for households with herd sizes beneath a threshold level. Conversely, if the drought frequency more than doubles relative to recent patterns, then the whole system becomes a poverty trap, in expectation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A vast literature is now available on ecosystem services (ES), their potential as a tool for analyzing intertwined processes of ecological and social change, and their monetary valuation. Much less is known about the social value of different ES for different social actors (SA), and their links with specific components of biodiversity. We unpack the social aspects of an interdisciplinary and multi-SA methodology that allows us to assess how different SA perceive and value different ES, and how they associate them with different components of biodiversity, ecological attributes, and ecosystem types. We apply the methodology to a study area in the Gran Chaco region of South America, presenting original social-ecological information from the field. Being affected by the rapid and widespread expansion of agribusiness over the woody ecosystems of southern South America, this location provides a policy-relevant context in which to test our approach. We identified six major ecosystem types and five relevant SA. We carried out 163 individual in- depth interviews and ran seven single-actor focus groups. We identified 116 ES, which were then aggregated into 22 more general categories. Although all SA perceived all ecosystem types as multifunctional, they showed markedly different perceptions of and interests in the ES provided by them. Subsistence farmers and extension officers valued a large number of ES primarily provided by the most pristine ecosystems. Members of conservation agencies and policymakers also identified a wide range of ES, spanning all ecosystem types. However, large farmers and cattle ranchers recognized a dependency on only a small number of ES. Therefore, the rapid expansion of agribusiness occurring in this region is a threat to a large number of ES considered valuable by a wide range of SA. Without necessarily having to resort to monetary valuation, our methodology provides a rigorous quantitative-qualitative way to compare the perspective of different SA, including scientists, and is thus useful for social-ecological assessment and action.},

abstract = {Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods?intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants, and injectables?together comprise a growing share of contraceptive use in low-income countries. Using DHS contraceptive calendar data this paper examines married women?s adoption and discontinuation of LARCs, other modern methods, and traditional/folkloric methods in 21 low-income countries. The two methods that require provider removal, IUDs and implants, have the lowest discontinuation rates. The discontinuation rate of injectables is on par with that of traditional methods and is lower than that of other non-LARC modern methods combined. Cost or access is rarely cited as an issue in discontinuation of any method. Failure rates of LARC methods are low, but four in ten episodes of LARC discontinuation are attributed to side effects or health concerns, more than double that of other modern methods combined. Three months after discontinuing while still in need (DWSIN), 15 to 20 percent of LARC users are at risk of an unwanted pregnancy. We model the hazard of DWSIN based on individual and country-level characteristics. Adjusted hazard models find that starting an IUD or injectable after birth, postpartum abstinence, or LAM significantly reduces the hazard of DWSIN. Additionally, living in a country with greater access to the method being used and higher-quality family planning programs reduces the hazard of DWSIN. These findings point to the benefits that postpartum family planning efforts and a supportive programmatic environment confer on sustained LARC use. },

However, their sufficiency and suitability in providing information for decision-makers is unclear. Here, we review the indicators brought together under the Biodiversity Indicator Partnership to monitor progress towards the Aichi Targets to determine where there are gaps. Of the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, Targets 2, 3 and 15 are missing indicators entirely. Scoring the indicators in relation to their alignment, temporal relevance and spatial scale shows additional gaps under Targets 1, 13 and 16–20. Predominately, gaps were found to be socio-economic in nature (i.e. benefits, pressures and responses) rather than status-related (i.e. states), principally due to a poor alignment between the indicator and the text of the Aichi Target. Hence, it is critical that existing indicators are properly resourced and maintained and new indicators developed to be able to effectively monitor biodiversity and its influencing factors to 2020 and beyond.},

While some are academic exercises, many are produced with the goal of drawing policy maker attention to regions that are particularly susceptible to climate impacts, either to mitigate the risk of humanitarian crises or conflicts or to target adaptation assistance. Hotspots mapping efforts address a range of issues and sectors such as vulnerable populations, humanitarian crises, conflict, agriculture and food security, and water resources. This paper offers a timely assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current hotspots mapping approaches with the goal of improving future efforts.

Using a novel culturomics approach, we analyse word usage within digitized texts to assess the chronological order in which scientists, the public, and policymakers engage in the conservation process for three prominent conservation issues: acid rain in North America, global DDT contamination, and the overexploitation of African elephants for ivory. Variation in the order and magnitude of sector responses among the three issues emphasizes that there are multiple pathways to conservation success and that science is just one component. Our study highlights that while scientists can initiate the process, policy change does not occur in the absence of public interest. We suggest that the fate of conservation action is not solely determined by the scientific soundness of the conservation plan, but rather requires the engagement of scientists, public, and policy makers alike.},

Reducing post-harvest losses in maize is an essential component in any strategy to make more food avail- able without increasing the burden on the natural environment. Solving the post-harvest management problems in maize will require cooperation and effective linkage among the following: research, extension, agro-industry, marketing system and fa- vorable policy environment. Biological and socio-economic causes of post-harvest losses in maize in Africa are discussed in relation to climate change and food security, and strategies to reduce the post-harvest losses are suggested.},

In contrast, the met need for family planning is only 8 percent.  Therefore, a major concern is which factors are contributing to the observed high level of unmet need for family planning in Ethiopia and which strategies can best bring about changes to the current situation. Many factors may contribute to the observed discrepancy in unmet need and met need; however, this study focuses on demographic and socioeconomic factors and individual perceptions and attitudes. The broad objective of this analysis is to examine the underlying factors of unmet need for family planning among Ethiopian women. Specifically, this study seeks to accomplish the following: 1) Analyze the characteristics of women with unmet need, 2) Examine attitudes toward family planning among women with unmet need, 3) Assess the major reasons for nonuse among women with unmet need, 4) Identify the main factors responsible for nonuse among women with unmet need for family planning.},

abstract = {The new scenario process for climate change research includes the creation of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) describing alternative societal development trends over the coming decades. Urbanization is a key aspect of development that is relevant to studies of mitigation, adaptation, and impacts. Incorporating urbanization into the SSPs requires a consistent set of global urbanization projections that cover long time horizons and span a full range of uncertainty. Existing urbanization projections do not meet these needs, in particular providing only a single scenario over the next few decades, a period during which urbanization is likely to be highly dynamic in many countries. We present here a new, long-term, global set of urbanization projections at country level that cover a plausible range of uncertainty. We create SSP-specific projections by choosing urbanization outcomes consistent with each SSP narrative. Results show that the world continues to urbanize in each of the SSPs but outcomes differ widely across them, with urbanization reaching 60{\%}, 79{\%}, and 92{\%} by the end of century in SSP3, SSP2, and SSP1/SSP4/SSP5, respectively. The degree of convergence in urbanization across countries also differs substantially, with largely convergent outcomes by the end of the century in SSP1 and SSP5 and persistent diversity in SSP3. This set of global, country-specific projections produces urbanization pathways that are typical of regions in different stages of urbanization and development levels, and can be extended to further elaborate assumptions about the styles of urban growth and spatial distributions of urban people and land cover occurring in each SSP.},

abstract = {With current annual production at over 600 million tonnes, wheat is the third largest crop in the world behind corn and rice, and an essential source of carbohydrates for millions of people. While wheat is grown over a wide range of environments, it is common in the major wheat-producing countries for grain filling to occur when soil moisture is declining and temperature is increasing. Average global temperatures have increased over the last decades and are predicted to continue rising, along with a greater frequency of extremely hot days. Such events have already been reported for major wheat growing regions in the world. However, the direct impact of past temperature variability and changes in averages and extremes on wheat production has not been quantified. Attributing changes in observed yields over recent decades to a single factor such as temperature is not possible due to the confounding effects of other factors. By using simulation modelling, we were able to separate the impact of temperature from other factors and show that the effect of temperature on wheat production has been underestimated. Surprisingly, observed variations in average growing-season temperatures of ±2°C in the main wheat growing regions of Australia can cause reductions in grain production of up to 50{\%}. Most of this can be attributed to increased leaf senescence as a result of temperatures {\textgreater}34°C. Temperature conditions during grain filling in the major wheat growing regions of the world are similar to the Australian conditions during grain filling. With average temperatures and the frequency of heat events projected to increase world-wide with global warming, yield reductions due to higher temperatures during the important grain-filling stage alone could substantially undermine future global food security. Adaptation strategies need to be considered now to prevent substantial yield losses in wheat from increasing future heat stress. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Brazil's population has undergone a major fertility decline in the past twenty years. Changing fertility patterns are analyzed in this report with data from the 1986 nationwide maternity-child health and contraceptive survey.Following Easterlin's "synthesis framework," fertility decline is viewed as a result of the modernization process, as the latter alters the mechanisms of fertility choices from natural forces to deliberate decisions on the part of individuals or families. Analyses of the proximate determinants of fertility in Brazil indicate that wife's education and religiosity constitutes the principle factors through which modernizations affects fertility. Traditional values, as measured by women's religiosity, increase both desired family size and costs of fertility regulation. they exert, however, no measurable effect on the couple's potential family size. Wife's education, in turn, affects fertility in more complex ways, as it tends to decrease both potential and desired family size. It also has a negative impact on the costs of regulation, as it increases size. It also has a negative impact of the costs of regulation,as it increases knowledge of contraception. Thus, an unanticipated consequence of rising women's education may be a reduction in the motivation for fertility control. },

abstract = {Public interest in nature is an important driver of the success of conservation actions, such that increasing public awareness of biodiversity has become a major conservation goal (i.e. Aichi Target 1). Macro-scale monitoring of public interest towards nature has thus far been difficult, but the enormous quantity of information generated by the internet allows for new approaches using culturomic techniques. For example, other things being equal, we would expect that the vernacular (common) names of charismatic species with high levels of public interest (e.g. tiger, elephant) to appear on more web-pages than less ‘cultural' species. Nevertheless, deriving metrics from such data is challenging because vernacular names often have multiple meanings (e.g. teal, jaguar) that could significantly bias culturomic metrics of cultural visibility. Scientific binomial names of species potentially avoid this problem because Latin is a ‘dead' language and the scientific name typically applies only to the biological organism. Here, we investigate whether standard scientific names: i) are a robust proxy of web salience of vernacular species names, and; ii) have the same statistical relationship with vernacular species names across different cultural and language groups. Automated internet searches were carried out for scientific and vernacular names from a global bird species list and six national bird species lists (Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Spain, Tanzania and USA). For national searches the results were restricted to country web domains. We found strong and consistent correlations between vernacular and scientific species names at both global and country level, independent of language and cultural differences. The universality of this relationship suggests that the web salience of scientific species names is a robust, cross-cultural indicator of species ‘culturalness'. Potential applications of this indicator include: i) the development of new indicators to assess public perceptions of biodiversity; ii) systematic identification of species with high cultural visibility; iii) empirical identification of the biogeographic, ecological, morphological and cultural characteristics of species that influence cultural visibility, globally and in different cultural settings, and; iv) near real-time monitoring of changes in species ‘culturalness'. The capture and processing of internet data is technically non-trivial, but can be replicated at low cost and has enormous potential for the creation of new macro-scale metrics of human-nature interactions.},

In the context of land-use changes, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of land-use on savanna vegetation and biodiversity. This study assesses the impact of land-use on savannas by comparing protected and communal areas. Vegetation relev{\'{e}}s were performed in the W National Park and its surrounding communal area in Burkina Faso. Vegetation types were established using ordination and clustering methods. We analyzed to find which environmental factors determine the occurrence of the vegetation types and whether land-use has a specific effect on diversity of vegetation types occurring in both areas. Furthermore, we tested the effect of land-use on vegetation structure and the occurrence of life forms and highly valued tree species. Our results reveal five vegetation types occurring in both areas. Elevation and soil characteristics played the most important role for the occurrence of the vegetation types. Land-use had an effect on vegetation structure, diversity, and the occurrence of life form and highly valued species. Our findings suggest that traditional human land-use does not automatically lead to loss of species and degradation of savanna habitats and that combination of communal and protected areas may be of great importance for the conservation of broad spectrum of biodiversity. Our study demonstrates the complexity of land-use impact on biodiversity patterns and provides insights on what kind of management activities may be most appropriate in both areas.},

abstract = {The role of governance has been receiving increasing attention from food security scholars in recent years. However, in spite of the recognition that governance matters, current knowledge of food security governance is rather fragmented. To provide some clarity in the debate about the role of governance in addressing food (in)security, this paper reports the results of a systematic review of the literature. The synthesis revolves around seven recurring themes: i) the view of governance as both a challenge and solution to food security; ii) a governability that is characterized by high degrees of complexity; iii) failures of the current institutional architectures; iv) the arrival of new players at the forefront; v) calls for coherency and coordination across multiple scales; vi) variation and conflict of ideas; and vii) calls for the allocation of sufficient resources and the integration of democratic values in food security governance. Two lines of discussion of this synthesis are raised. First, the researcher argues that a large proportion of the food security governance literature is characterized by an optimist governance perspective, i.e., a view of governance as a problem-solving mechanism. Complementing this body of literature with alternative governance perspectives in future research may strengthen current understandings of food security governance. Approaching food security as a {\&}{\#}8216;wicked problem{\&}{\#}8217; could provide valuable insights in this respect. Second, food security governance as a research field could make headway by engaging in further empirical investigation of current governance arrangements, particularly at sub-national levels.

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Information about the global structure of agriculture and nutrient production and its diversity is essential to improve present understanding of national food production patterns, agricultural livelihoods, and food chains, and their linkages to land use and their associated ecosystems services. Here we provide a plausible breakdown of global agricultural and nutrient production by farm size, and also study the associations between farm size, agricultural diversity, and nutrient production. This analysis is crucial to design interventions that might be appropriately targeted to promote healthy diets and ecosystems in the face of population growth, urbanisation, and climate change. 

METHODS
We used existing spatially-explicit global datasets to estimate the production levels of 41 major crops, seven livestock, and 14 aquaculture and fish products. From overall production estimates, we estimated the production of vitamin A, vitamin B12, folate, iron, zinc, calcium, calories, and protein. We also estimated the relative contribution of farms of different sizes to the production of different agricultural commodities and associated nutrients, as well as how the diversity of food production based on the number of different products grown per geographic pixel and distribution of products within this pixel (Shannon diversity index [H]) changes with different farm sizes. 

FINDINGS
Globally, small and medium farms (≤50 ha) produce 51–77{\%} of nearly all commodities and nutrients examined here. However, important regional differences exist. Large farms ({\textgreater}50 ha) dominate production in North America, South America, and Australia and New Zealand. In these regions, large farms contribute between 75{\%} and 100{\%} of all cereal, livestock, and fruit production, and the pattern is similar for other commodity groups. By contrast, small farms (≤20 ha) produce more than 75{\%} of most food commodities in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, south Asia, and China. In Europe, west Asia and north Africa, and central America, medium-size farms (20–50 ha) also contribute substantially to the production of most food commodities. Very small farms (≤2 ha) are important and have local significance in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, and south Asia, where they contribute to about 30{\%} of most food commodities. The majority of vegetables (81{\%}), roots and tubers (72{\%}), pulses (67{\%}), fruits (66{\%}), fish and livestock products (60{\%}), and cereals (56{\%}) are produced in diverse landscapes (H{\textgreater}1{\textperiodcentered}5). Similarly, the majority of global micronutrients (53–81{\%}) and protein (57{\%}) are also produced in more diverse agricultural landscapes (H{\textgreater}1{\textperiodcentered}5). By contrast, the majority of sugar (73{\%}) and oil crops (57{\%}) are produced in less diverse ones (H≤1{\textperiodcentered}5), which also account for the majority of global calorie production (56{\%}). The diversity of agricultural and nutrient production diminishes as farm size increases. However, areas of the world with higher agricultural diversity produce more nutrients, irrespective of farm size. 

INTERPRETATION
Our results show that farm size and diversity of agricultural production vary substantially across regions and are key structural determinants of food and nutrient production that need to be considered in plans to meet social, economic, and environmental targets. At the global level, both small and large farms have key roles in food and nutrition security. Efforts to maintain production diversity as farm sizes increase seem to be necessary to maintain the production of diverse nutrients and viable, multifunctional, sustainable landscapes.

Anthropometric indicators are relatively precise, readily available for most countries, reflect the preferences and concerns of many poor people, consistent with reckoning the phenomenon directly in the space of functionings, intuitive, easy to use for advocacy, and consistent over time and across subgroups. Anthropometric indicators can therefore complement (but not replace) standard indicators of income/consumption poverty, especially for comparisons across subgroups, within households, across countries, and in the long run. In addition, the paper analyses spells of change in malnutrition over time, finding that the association between economic growth and chronic child malnutrition is very small (but statistically significant) and much lower than the elasticity of growth on poverty. The policy implication of this finding is that direct interventions aimed at reducing infant malnutrition are required.},

Spousal violence is one of the forms of gender-based violence prevalent in Nepal. The objective of this study is to understand women?s empowerment and spousal violence in relation to health outcomes of women and their children. The study analyzed data on 3,084 currently married women age 15-49 from the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey. A composite Women?s Empowerment Index (WEI) was developed that included five variables: i) household decision-making, ii) ownership of land or house, iii) membership in community group, iv) proportion earning cash, and v) women?s education. The WEI classified women into three empowerment levels, whereby 17, 48, and 35 percent of married women were in high, moderate, and low empowerment levels, respectively. Variations in women?s empowerment were distinct by age, caste/ethnicity, and wealth quintile.  Less empowered women and women who had experienced spousal violence were more likely to have anemic children. Children of women who had experienced spousal violence had lower odds of being immunized, even after adjusting for related factors. These findings suggest that women?s empowerment and spousal violence appear to have important implications for the health of women and their children. It is recommended that a holistic approach to improving the health of women and children in Nepal incorporate multi-sectoral programming to promote women?s empowerment and reduce gender-based violence.},

abstract = {Problem statement: The decision of crop selection and the output of agricultural production are highly determined by the environmental factors, especially rainfall and water availability. In the tropical area, particularly in Malaysia, influences of these exogenous variables are so high that overall agricultural productions are now vulnerable. Crops are affected through rainfall in two different ways-high and low rainfalls. Avoiding the problem of low rainfall is nearly possible through irrigation, but over rainfall at the end of crop cycle causes destructive damages of the output. Approach: This study uses descriptive statistics to analyze the fact and uses unit root test to measure the predictability of rainfall. The raw data is taken from 8 stations from 1980 to 2007. Results: Shifting crop cycle is also not fruitful due to un-predictive changes of rainfall. All combination of crop cycle is also affected in a similar way. Government subsidy in agricultural sector is remarkably increasing, but farmers are not able to cope properly with the environmental changes, especially for the cash crops and seasonal crops production. Conclusion: Under this circumstance, in the short run, adaptation approaches should be followed in farmer level and policy level. In the long run, technological advancement will play the most crucial role to solve the problem. {\textcopyright} 2010 Science Publications.},

abstract = {Dynamic simulation models allow an integrated representation of human and biophysical driving forces, to test their influence on land use. Dynamic models emphasise the interactions among the components of the system and take into account feedback loops and threshold effects. In this paper, the SALU model was used to generate "what-if" scenarios to explore hypotheses on the relative role of driving forces of land-use change in the Sudano-sahelian countries of Africa. The model simulations provided useful insights to better understand the processes of land-use change. Rural population growth represents a larger stimuli for land-use change than urban population growth. Demographic variables have a greater impact on land use than recurring droughts. The demographic driving forces are slow variables while rainfall is a fast variable. Recurring droughts could be viewed as trigger events, and urban population growth and consumption as mediating factors, while rural population growth defines long-term trends. Technological change defines thresholds in land use. Land-use change results from interactions between driving forces. The timing of occurrence of drought with respect to transitions in land use has a major impact on land-use change. Polices aimed at protecting pastoral land and supporting agricultural intensification both contribute to maintain pastoral activities. Simulating a conservative carrying capacity has a major impact on land use predictions. By examining environmental, social and economic implications of various land-use scenarios, the modelling approach adopted in SALU can provide support for decision-making. 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Background: Examination of maternal experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) and depression as risk factors for food insecurity can provide a more nuanced understanding of the role that the family environment and women's health plays in the lives of families with young children that experience food insecurity. We investigated the longitudinal association between mothers' experiences of IPV and household food insecurity, and whether maternal depression mediated the relationship. Methods: IPV, depression, and food insecurity were assessed among 1,690 socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers of young children who participated in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study. Longitudinal multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between IPV measured 3 years after the child's birth and increase in food insecurity from child's third to fifth birthday, as well as the mediating role of maternal depression, controlling for a number of maternal and household characteristics. Results: Mothers who reside in food insecure households and those who experience IPV share similar charac-teristics of socioeconomic disadvantage and a greater propensity for depression compared to their counterparts. Mothers' experiences of IPV predicted an increased risk of household food insecurity two years later, and the relationship was mediated by maternal depression. Conclusions: Food insecure mothers may benefit from widespread assistance. Targeting issues central to women's health must become a priority in combating food insecurity. Having IPV and mental health screenings coincide with food assistance applications may help identify women who would benefit from resources designed to increase physical safety, psychological well-being, and food security.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, World Health Organization. All rights reserved. Objective To estimate the prevalence of childhood wasting and to investigate the effects of drought and conflict on wasting in crisisaffected areas within Ethiopia. Methods We searched the Complex Emergency Database for nutrition surveys carried out in Ethiopia over the period 2000–2013. We extracted data on the prevalence of wasting (weight-for-height z-scores below –2) among children aged 6–59 months for areas of Ethiopia that had sufficient data available. Data on any conflict events (irrespective of magnitude or impact) and episodes of seasonal drought affecting the survey areas were extracted from publicly available data sources. Random-effects Bayesian meta-analysis was used to synthesize the evidence from 231 small-scale surveys. Findings From the total sample of 175 607 children analysed, the pooled number of children wasted was 21 709. The posterior median prevalence of wasting was 11.0{\%} (95{\%} credible interval, CrI: 10.3–11.7) over the 14-year period. Compared with areas unaffected by drought, the estimated prevalence of wasting was higher in areas affected by moderate levels of drought (posterior odds ratio, OR: 1.34; 95{\%} CrI: 1.05–1.72) but similar in severe drought-affected areas (OR: 0.96; 95{\%} CrI: 0.68–1.35). Although the pooled prevalence of wasting was higher in conflict-affected than unaffected areas, the difference was not plausible (OR: 1.02; 95{\%} CrI: 0.82–1.26). Conclusion Despite an overall declining trend, a wasting problem persists among children in Ethiopia. Conflict events did not have a major impact on childhood wasting. Nutrition interventions should go beyond severe drought-prone areas to incorporate areas where moderate droughts occur.},

abstract = {Much of the research literature about the use of family planning generalizes contraceptive use among all women, using age as a covariate. In Uganda, a country with divergent trends in modern family planning use among younger and older married women, we hypothesize that factors associated with contraceptive use operate in a fundamentally different way  among married women in two age groups: 15-24 and 25-34. We tested this hypothesis using data from the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) in 2006 and 2011.  We restricted the sample from each round to fecund, non-pregnant married women age 15-34 who were sexually active within one year prior to the survey, resulting in a sample of 2,802 women in 2006 and 2,814 women in 2011. In Uganda, as in most countries, the level of modern contraceptive use is much lower among younger married women compared with older women.  We used logistic regression to model the relationship between selected independent variables and the outcome variable (current use of modern contraception) for each group of women in each year. We found that the key factors associated with current use of modern contraceptives among younger married women age 15-24 in both 2006 and 2011 were residence and desire for children, while among women age 25-34, the significant factors associated with contraceptive use in both rounds were education level, household wealth and desire for children.  The findings suggest that increasing secondary education for women and improving the livelihood of the population overall is important. Family planning programs should be intensified to meet the needs of young married women in rural areas of the country.},

@article{Gray2013,
abstract = {Long-term data archives such as Landsat offer the potential for understanding land cover dynamics over large areas, but limited progress has been made towards realizing this potential due to data availability and computational limitations. Those limitations are less relevant now, and there is renewed interest in developing reliable methods of automatically and consistently classifying time series of remotely sensed images. Our objective was to develop a method of automatically classifying temporally irregular time series (i.e., non-anniversary date images in consecutive years) of images with a minimum of parameterization and a priori information. In contrast to traditional signature extension methods, the automatic adaptive signature generalization procedure (AASG) adapts class spectral signatures to individual images and therefore requires no image correction procedure. Class signatures are derived from pixels with stable land cover through time. We tested the performance of AASG relative to traditional signature extension with various image corrections, and explored the sensitivity of AASG to a thresholding parameter (c) controlling stable site identification. AASG performed as well as signature extension with atmospheric correction (??=0.68), and better than signature extension with relative (??=0.65) and TOA reflectance (??=0.56) image corrections for a summer-summer image pair. Additionally, we demonstrated the unique ability of AASG to adapt class signatures to phenological differences by classifying a summer-winter image pair with a modest reduction in overall accuracy (??=0.66). Observed sensitivity to c supported the hypothesis of an optimum value yielding enough training sites to describe class spectral variability, but conservative enough to minimize contamination of signatures due to classification errors. AASG offers significant advantages over traditional signature extension, particularly for temporally irregular time series. Although we demonstrated a simple implementation, the AASG approach is flexible and we outline several refinements which stand to improve performance. This development represents significant progress towards realizing the potential of long-term data archives to gain long-term understandings of global land cover dynamics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper examines the effects of climate variability on schooling outcomes in rural Ethiopia. Investments in education serve as an important pathway out of poverty, yet reduced agricultural productivity due to droughts or temperature shocks may affect educational attainment if children receive poorer nutrition during early childhood, are required to participate in household income generation during schooling ages, or if households can no longer pay for school-related expenses. We link longitudinal socioeconomic, demographic, and schooling data from the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey to high-resolution gridded climate data to measure exposure to temperature and precipitation relative to historical norms. We then estimate a set of multivariate regression models to understand how climate variability impacts grade attainment and school enrollment. Results indicate that early life climatic conditions – namely milder temperatures during all seasons and greater rainfall during the summer agricultural season – are associated with an increased likelihood of a child having completed any education. In addition, greater summer rainfall during both early life and school ages is associated with having completed any schooling as well as with attending school at the time of the survey. These findings suggest that future climate change may reduce children's school participation in rural Sub-Saharan Africa, slowing progress toward human development goals and poverty alleviation.},

The minority of households using forests for coping is asset-poor and lives in villages specialized on forests, in particular timber extraction.

abstract = {Introduction: In Ethiopia, despite existent intensive efforts to improve maternal health, the proportion of births delivered at home remains high and is still the top priority among the national health threats. The study aimed to examine effects of individual and community-level factors in women?s decision to deliver at home versus in a health facility.   Methods: Data for this study were obtained from the nationally representative 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS 2011) and focused on a sample from 576 communities of 7,908 women whose most recent births were within five years preceding the survey. The data were analyzed using a two level-mixed-effects logistic regression model to determine the individual and community-level factors associated with place of delivery.  Results: In Ethiopia, 88{\%} of deliveries took place at home. Both individual and community-level factors were associated with women?s choice for place of delivery. Lower educational levels of mothers (OR=2.74; 95{\%} CI: 1.84, 4.70) and their husbands (OR=2.31; 95{\%} CI: 1.68, 3.18) were both positively associated with the odds of giving birth at home. The net odds of home delivery among mothers without antenatal care (ANC) visits for their recent pregnancy was 3.7 times higher than among mothers who made the recommended four or more ANC visits (OR=3.72; 95{\%} CI: 2.85, 4.83). Non-exposure to radio or television messages (OR=1.51; 95{\%} CI: 1.13, 2.01), parity of six or more births, (OR=2.68, 95{\%} CI: 1.96, 3.68) and perceived problems reaching health facilities due to distance (OR=1.29, 95{\%} CI: 1.03, 1.62) were positively associated with home birth. With regard to the community-level characteristics, rural communities (OR=4.67, 95{\%} CI: 3.06, 7.11), pastoralist communities (OR=4.53, 95{\%} CI: 2.81, 7.28), communities with higher poverty levels (OR=1.49; 95{\%} CI: 1.08, 2.22), and those with lower ANC utilization (OR=2.01, 95{\%} CI: 1.42, 2.85) and women in areas with perceived problem of distance to health facilities (OR=1.29; 95{\%} CI: 1.03, 1.62) had a positive influence on women to give birth at home.  Conclusion: Not only individual characteristics of the women but also community-level factors determine women?s decision to deliver at home. Thus efforts to decrease the proportion of births delivered at home in Ethiopia should focus both on individuals and on communities.},

We found that regulating services were the most commonly mapped, followed by provisioning, cultural, and supporting services. Secondary (readily available) data were used more frequently than primary data to map ES. Biophysical data (land-cover variables) and mixed sources (databases like global statistics) were the most commonly employed ones. Most studies were performed at the regional or at the national scale. The most commonly used method to model services was the development of models based on the well-known causal relationships between environmental variables, followed by the extrapolation of ES values from primary data to the total analyzed area frequently using land-cover maps. Our synthesis reveals that the majority of studies are based on secondary data, applied at broad scales, without validation techniques. There is an urgent need to develop methods for deepening our understanding of the social–ecological processes behind the supply of ES in order to improve our ability to map ES for decision making.},

abstract = {The combined food, fuel, and financial crises of 2007-2009 had severe and widespread negative impacts around the world. Two key questions challenging governments were: how long would the high prices last and with what effects on food security and nutrition over the longer run? This paper considers the drivers of the crisis and explores if, unlike past shocks, the recent price increases reflect structural changes in food price formation that will have lasting global implications. New cross-commodity relationships allowed prices to spike, although there was no shortage of food at the global level nor indeed a significant downturn in recent yields. Yet recent record levels of farm production were also mirrored by growing numbers of people chronically undernourished and/or micronutrient deficient. The gap between supply and need was underpinned by growing urban demand, consumption of processed and higher-value foods (including meat), biofuel policy, and purchasing power erosion, but also by short-term market-distorting policies implemented by governments responding to perceived shortages of food. Thus, the impact of future food price crises will depend largely on what policymakers chose to do in response to the peaks and what they do not do during the troughs. Appropriate investments are urgently needed not just in smallholder developing country agriculture, but in effective food policies and targeted programming that can reverse the recent negative trends in nutrition and that support access globally to improved diet quality as well as food quantity.},

abstract = {Maternal mortality continues to be high in many countries of the developing world. Focused antenatal care (ANC) and childbirth with a skilled attendant have been highlighted as effective interventions to reduce this burden. However, better understanding of conditions such as postpartum hemorrhage?the largest killer?and its occurrence in the early postpartum period have shown the importance of early and universal postpartum care (PPC). This study was undertaken to analyze the variables (occurrence, timing, and background characteristics) associated with receipt of postpartum care in 30 developing countries representing the major regions of the world. Data from Demographic and Health Surveys carried out between 1999 and 2004 were used in the study. Results show that about half of all births in these countries continue to occur outside health institutions, and in seven out of ten births mothers do not receive any postpartum care. Of the noninstitutional births for which mothers receive postpartum care, the average timing of the first postpartum checkup is three days after birth. If all births are counted?assuming institutional births receive postpartum care 12 hours after delivery?the average timing of postpartum care is two days following delivery. The characteristics of women most often associated with receiving postpartum care are belonging to a household with higher wealth status and having received antenatal care. Education beyond the primary level, urban residence, and media exposure are strongly correlated with receiving postpartum care. However, some relationships are less clear, or are reversed, for postpartum care performed by traditional birth attendants or other nonskilled attendants. This paper highlights specific countries where, despite low numbers of institutional births, many women do receive postpartum care. It is suggested that countries should invest in ensuring that all births?whether at a health institution or at home?are attended by a skilled provider at the time of delivery or within a few hours, to help reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. },

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

There is growing evidence of the connections between slow growth in height early in life and impaired health and educational and economic performance later in life. Recent research findings, including follow-up of an intervention trial in Guatemala, indicate that stunting can have long-term effects on cognitive development, school achievement, economic productivity in adulthood and maternal reproductive outcomes. This evidence has contributed to the growing scientific consensus that tackling childhood stunting is a high priority for reducing the global burden of disease and for fostering economic development. Follow-up of randomized intervention trials is needed in other regions to add to the findings of the Guatemala trial. Further research is also needed to: understand the pathways by which prevention of stunting can have long-term effects; identify the pathways through which the non-genetic transmission of nutritional effects is mediated in future generations; and determine the impact of interventions focused on linear growth in early life on chronic disease risk in adulthood.},

abstract = {Background: Child stunting is a public health problem in developing countries. Studies have shown that maternal nutrition is an important determinant of fetal and postnatal growth. However, the diets of women in developing countries are often deficient in energy, protein and vital micronutrients. Improving the health and nutrition of mothers and mothers-to-be is important in addressing many underlying causes of child malnutrition. Hence strategies to improve children?s nutritional status and growth should include interventions to improve nutrition of pregnant and lactating women. The World Health Organization (WHO) advises that, to improve children?s growth, pregnant women in developing countries should take iron supplements, and lactating mothers should take Vitamin A supplements. Despite the implementation of these interventions, there is little information on how antenatal and postnatal maternal micronutrient supplements influence child growth in developing countries.    Objective: Evaluate the role of maternal Vitamin A and iron supplements on children?s nutritional status and growth. We compare the differences in st unting between children whose mothers received one or both of these two micronutrient supplements during pregnancy and after delivery and children whose mothers did not receive either of the micronutrients.  Methods: We use cross-sectional survey data from the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey of 2010-11 (ZDHS 2010-11). A stratified, two-stage cluster design was used for the survey. For our analysis we use data from 2,007 children under age 3 whose anthropometric measurements were recorded during the survey. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify determinants of child nutritional status, defined as height-for-age (stunting).  Results: Forty percent of the mothers received postpartum Vitamin A supplements, while 53{\%} received iron supplements during pregnancy. Results show that maternal iron supplements reduced child stunting (aOR = 0.73; 95{\%} CI = (0.58, 0.91); p = 0.006). However, Vitamin A supplementation did not have an effect on child stunting (aOR = 1.09; 95{\%} CI = (0.86, 1.37); p = 0 .474).  Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that maternal iron supplementation during pregnancy reduces early childhood malnutrition, especially stunting. Postpartum Vitamin A supplementation, however, does not appear to have an effect on the nutritional status of children. The effects of Vitamin A supplements on child nutrition may be indirect, and may not necessarily be on child growth but rather on other children?s health and developmental issues.},

Together with the high level of fertility and a low level of contraceptive use, this suggests that the population will continue to grow at a fast pace for at least another generation.  This high rate of population growth has negatively impacted the economic development of the country. The population is predominantly rural, with only 15 {\%} residing in urban areas. More than 95{\%} of the rural population are involved in agriculture. Food shortages are common because most of the farming depends on the infrequent rains, and the soil fertility is poor because of continuous plowing. The 2000 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) reported that the total fertility rate in the country stands at 5.9, which is among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Of currently married women, 14{\%}  have never heard of family planning, while only 17 {\%} have ever used a method. Current use of family planning is very low and stands at 8{\%} among the same group of women. It is necessary to identify the reasons for such a high unmet need and present program options that meet the need for family planning. Therefore, the in-depth analysis of the DHS data on the evaluation of program options to meet unmet need for family planning will provide critical information that can be used to develop programs and strategies.},

abstract = {Maternal and child malnutrition in low-income and middle-income countries encompasses both undernutrition and a growing problem with overweight and obesity. Low body-mass index, indicative of maternal undernutrition, has declined somewhat in the past two decades but continues to be prevalent in Asia and Africa. Prevalence of maternal overweight has had a steady increase since 1980 and exceeds that of underweight in all regions. Prevalence of stunting of linear growth of children younger than 5 years has decreased during the past two decades, but is higher in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere and globally affected at least 165 million children in 2011; wasting affected at least 52 million children. Deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc result in deaths; deficiencies of iodine and iron, together with stunting, can contribute to children not reaching their developmental potential. Maternal undernutrition contributes to fetal growth restriction, which increases the risk of neonatal deaths and, for survivors, of stunting by 2 years of age. Suboptimum breastfeeding results in an increased risk for mortality in the first 2 years of life. We estimate that undernutrition in the aggregate - including fetal growth restriction, stunting, wasting, and deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc along with suboptimum breastfeeding - is a cause of 3{\textperiodcentered}1 million child deaths annually or 45{\%} of all child deaths in 2011. Maternal overweight and obesity result in increased maternal morbidity and infant mortality. Childhood overweight is becoming an increasingly important contributor to adult obesity, diabetes, and non-communicable diseases. The high present and future disease burden caused by malnutrition in women of reproductive age, pregnancy, and children in the first 2 years of life should lead to interventions focused on these groups. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change may negatively impact education among children via exposure to extreme temperature and precipitation conditions. We link census data from 29 countries across the global tropics to high-resolution gridded climate data to understand how climatic conditions experienced in utero and during early childhood affect educational attainment at ages 12 to 16. We show that exposure to higher-than-average temperatures during the prenatal and early-life period is associated with fewer years of schooling in Southeast Asia. In this region, a child who experiences temperatures 2 SDs above average is predicted to attain 1.5 fewer years of schooling than one who experiences average temperatures. In addition, early-life rainfall is positively correlated with attainment in West and Central Africa as well as Southeast Asia, and negatively correlated with attainment in Central America and the Caribbean. While we expected that children from the most educated households would be buffered from these effects, we discover that they tend to experience the greatest educational penalties when exposed to hotter early-life conditions and, in some regions, to drier conditions. For example, among the most educated households in West and Central Africa, predicted schooling is 1.8 years lower for children who experience early-life rainfall 2 SDs below average versus 2 SDs above average, while the difference is just 0.8 years for children from the least educated households. These results suggest that development and educational gains in the tropics could be undermined by climate change, even for better-off households.},

Drought, which negatively affects both women and men in some respects, affects women more due to their combined reproductive and productive workload. Focusing on the Volta Rural Water Supply Project, the article suggests that to reduce women's excessive workload, seasonal migration of men, and hunger arising from drought, development organisations need to incorporate irrigation into rural water supply projects in agro-based economies that are drought-prone. As well, it suggests that equal and full involvement of women in planning and implementation of water projects is essential. {\textcopyright} Oxfam GB 2010.},

abstract = {Improvements in agricultural production have drastically increased grain yields in the past half-century. Despite this growth in productivity and calories available per capita, malnutrition - both undernutrition and, increasingly, overweight - remains pervasive. Though nutrition is critical to human health, it has yet to be systematically integrated into assessments of agricultural and food systems. Using three complementary diversity metrics, we find strong associations between nutritional diversity of national food supplies and key human health outcomes, while controlling for socio-economic factors. For low-income countries the diversity of agricultural goods produced by a country is a strong predictor for food supply diversity; for middle- and high-income countries national income and trade are better predictors. Our results highlight the importance of diversity in national food systems for human health. We provide metrics for agricultural and food security policies to consider nutritional diversity.},

abstract = {Despite political instability, armed conflict, poor economic status, and difficulty in accessing health services, Nepal  has made considerable progress in improving reproductive health over the last two decades. There has been substantial progress in reducing maternal mortality, under-five mortality, and the total fertility rate (TFR). Nepal is on track to meet Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 4 (reducing child mortality rates) and 5 (improving maternal health), and has even received international awards such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) award in 2009 for reducing child mortality, the MDG Summit award in 2010 for reducing maternal mortality, and the Resolve award from the Global Leaders Council for Reproductive Health in 2012 for improving maternal and neonatal health (WHO and UNICEF, 2012).  Despite these gains, Nepal?s progress on MDG 5b, universal access to reproductive health, as measured by the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) and by the level of unmet need for family planning, appears to have slowed. Such evidence raises the question, why has fertility declined so rapidly in Nepal despite stagnation of contraceptive prevalence? This paper examines whether patterns in male migration can help account for the surprising decline in fertility in Nepal despite a stall in the uptake of contraceptives between 2006 and 2011. Nepal has a long history of labor migration, both internal and international (Sharma and Sharma, 2011). This trend has been increasing over the years, particularly among males. On average, at least 1,099 Nepali migrant workers leave the country every day.},

abstract = {This study is based on the premise that, in the Sahel/Sudanian belt of Africa, the main determinants of interannual variation in vegetation dynamics are rainfall and land cover type. We analyzed the spatio-temporal sensitivity of the NOAA-AVHRR 8km-resolution vegetation index (NDVI) to (i) annual rainfall variability (0.5°×0.5° resolution) acquired over a 25-year period (1982-2006); and (ii) land use changes in the different eco-climatic regions of the Bani catchment in Mali (130000km
                        2). During the period 1982-2006, there was no clear trend in rainfall over the catchment, whereas there was a strong positive trend in the NDVI, both when the NDVI values were corrected using annual rainfall variability and when they were not. We divided the catchment into three eco-climatic regions based on the relationship between the annual NDVI and rainfall. In each region, we analyzed the observed greening in relation to changes in land use after correcting for the effect of annual rainfall on the NDVI. Results show that there is a mixed level of agreement between the land cover changes at the grid cell scale and the spatial pattern of the NDVI trend. Increased cropping does not explain the increase in the annual NDVI, except in the Sahelian part of the catchment. We hypothesize that the natural vegetation dynamics related to the non-linear rainfall patterns during the 25-year study period were responsible for these results. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{VanVliet2013,
abstract = {Large areas of the tropical forest landscapes are still occu- pied – partly or fully – by swidden cultivation, but it is also clear that in many areas both the extent and intensity of swidden cultivation are changing. This is not new as it has always been a dynamic system used when it is opportune and changed or even dropped when other more favorable options for land and labor use, income, etc. appear. It seems that these changes now occur faster in some regions and slower or not at all in others (van Vliet et al. 2012). Political and economic pressures are the main drivers that have encouraged or enforced such changes, particularly towards more intensive agricultural practices or to other types of land use (urbanization, large scale plantations, protected areas, extractive concessions, etc.). However, the nature of these changes in swidden cultivation are not well docu- mented, partly because swidden fields and the various suc- cessional stages of woody re-growth associated with it are often categorized as ‘unclassified' or ‘degraded' land or lumped together with other land cover categories (Padoch et al. 2007; Schmidt-Vogt et al. 2009). Swidden cultivation is a smallholder category that government authorities find difficult to quantify because it forms part of a complex and diversified production system, together with other multiple small scale land use types (Gleave 1996; Padoch et al. 2007) and there is also little political interest in understanding the logic inherent to swidden cultivation and to quantify the number of people dependent on swidden as they are usually not a desired category of farmers to have appearing in official statistics (Mertz et al. 2009a). It is obvious that if such basic information is unavailable, planners and policy- makers have no sound basis for decisions on land use and development in the poorest regions of their countries.},
